<h1>Permitting & Mitigation in Latin America</h1>
<b> AN ECOSYSTEMS SERVICES APPROACH</b>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="http://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/colombiaopenpit.JPG" alt="Columbian coal mine" width="250" /> </div>
<p>At the Natural Capital Project, we are developing new approaches and tools to integrate ecosystem services into permitting and mitigation decisions. We are working on a number of projects to assess the impacts of development on ecosystem services and design mitigation activities to offset ecosystem service losses. Working with partners in Latin America, NatCap has used our approach to quantify the impacts of proposed coal mine and road development on ecosystem service provision in Colombia and Peru, and to assess the degree to which mitigation could be achieved through restoration and protection. In collaboration with The Nature Conservancy and the Colombian Ministry of Environment, we are developing a specialized software tool to aid ministry personnel in evaluating permit requests and determine mitigation requirements for future development projects. This tool is the first step in developing a tool that can be applied to ecosystem service impact assessment and mitigation more generally.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Ecosystem Services into Environmental Impact Assessments</h2>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/110/277626621_b324f4d8c8_m.jpg" alt="Amazonian People" width="250" /></div>
<p>Development can create new jobs, improve transportation and communication, and provide cheaper energy. However, these benefits often also come with environmental costs, including pollution of water and air, lost access to outdoor recreation, and threats to biodiversity.</p>
<p>Nearly 200 countries require the completion of an environmental impact assessment and of these, one-third also require mitigation to offset environmental degradation. By incorporating ecosystem services into environmental impact assessments, we can quantify the services being lost, and to whom, so they can be mitigated accordingly. It can also help us understand the impacts of development on human wellbeing and social equity.   Including ecosystem services into the impact assessment and mitigation process is already required by a growing number of lending institutions, including the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank, and can help countries and organizations reduce risk to project success and avoid unintended consequences from development.</p>
<p>While most countries require mitigation to offset environmental degradation that results, none requires an explicit accounting of people in these efforts. Scientists at NatCap have developed a new approach to mitigation that identifies ecosystem service winners and losers. We are developing a new tool that can map the flows of ecosystem services to different populations such as indigenous and urban communities, and how those flows might change under various mitigation options. Addressing mitigation in this manner avoids the creation of social injustice that occurs when ecosystem services like clean drinking water or recreational opportunities are restored to some people but not others. This approach is a promising foundation for future mitigation policy that places a premium on human well-being. </p>
 
<p>The NatCap approach to impact assessment and mitigation can help people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan development to avoid and minimize ecosystem service losses</li>
<li>Design mitigation to efficiently offset ecosystem services losses</li>
<li>Quantify impacts of development and mitigation activities on people, including consequences for social equity</li>
<li>Determine the potential to reach no net loss of ecosystem services with mitigation</li>
<li>Reduce risk of unintended environmental consequences from development</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impacts of Coal Mining in Columbia</h2>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Vista_cerrejon.JPG" alt="Columbian coal mine" width="250" /></div>
<p>As the government of Colombia prepares to grant new mining concessions, it also requires mitigation of environmental impacts from development to both people and the natural environment. Working with the Ministry of Environment and The Nature Conservancy, the Natural Capital Project evaluated the impacts of new and proposed coal mine permits on drinking water quality regulation services in the Cesar Department. We also assessed the potential to mitigate negative impacts by protecting or restoring previously identified priority areas. Our analyses showed where mitigation was likely to offset the impacts of mine expansion, and for which mines full mitigation is not likely to be possible. </p>

<h2>Preliminary Results</h2>
<br />
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Ecosystem  services can be incorperated into permitting and mitigation decisions</b>, and can be particularly valuable in the environmental impact assessment process. </li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>It is important to keep track of who are the ecosystem service winners and losers</b>, which is why we have developed a <a href="servicesheds.html">servieshed</a> approach in order to track who is loosing ecosystem services from development, and who is gaining ecosystem services from mitigation efforts, as they are not always the same people.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>It is not always possible to offset the ecosystem service impacts to all people</b>, as we found to be the case in our work in the Peruvian Amazon.</li>
