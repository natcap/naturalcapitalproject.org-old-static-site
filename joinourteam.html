<p><a name="hydro" id="hydro"></a><b>Senior Hydrologist</b> (Application review
begins November 15, 2010)</p>
<br>
<p>Are you a hydrologist with a desire to work in the Stanford community
 to make game-changing contributions at the nexus of hydrology, 
development and conservation? Do you have a personal desire to solve 
some of our biggest environmental problems at local and global scales? 
Do you thrive in an environment where your ideas are refined by 
interactions with experts from other fields, and where your work is 
tested and applied in real-world decisions?</p>
<p>We are a collaborative group of researchers and practitioners who 
need expertise to translate and simplify complex hydrological, 
geological and biogeochemical processes into simple, credible models 
useful for decision makers in conservation, land use planning and 
natural resource management. We seek a senior hydrologist to help us 
make a global impact on major decisions about human well-being, 
sustainability, and the use of our lands and waters.</p>
<p>We are a partnership among Stanford University's Woods
Institute for the Environment, University of Minnesota's Institute on
the Environment, The Nature Conservancy, and World Wildlife
Fund,developing tools to model and map the distribution of biodiversity
and the flow of multiple ecosystem services across land- and seascapes.
Our core team is based in Seattle, Washington, DC and at Stanford, and
we have active partners around the globe. This position is housed at Stanford University.</p>
<p>We seek a talented and experienced hydrologist with strong leadership
 and communication skills to advance the development, testing and 
application of water-related ecosystem service models. We look to this 
individual to establish The Natural Capital Project as a leader in this 
emerging field. </p>

over a three year period. The DoD is responsible for managing millions 
of acres within the US, and this project focuses on improving land-use 
decisions by incorporating ecosystem services into management decisions.</p> 
<p>Funding for this project supports the development of a 
multi-disciplinary team of researchers focused on increasing the 
efficiency of land-use decisions by the DoD. This team will collaborate 
to apply InVEST, which will inform resource-management decisions on the 
demonstration sites and may be incorporated into broader DoD 
installation-management protocols.</p>
<p>The successful applicant will work in a team to adapt and apply the 
InVEST ecosystem-service models and will then synthesize these results
