<h2>Science-Policy Intern - Integrating ecosystem services into decision-making</h2>
<strong>Description:</strong>
<p>Intern sought to help consolidate new knowledge and tools at the science-policy interface for ecosystem services; build and synthesize evidence that demonstrates the power of ecosystem service approaches; and, mainstream results by bringing them to the attention of potential users and decision makers.</p>
<p>Specific areas of focus may include:
<ul>
	<li>mainstreaming ecosystem services into policy and decision-making</li>
	<li>institutional and policy analysis</li>
	<li>scenario development</li>
	<li>connecting ecosystem services to human wellbeing</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The successful applicant will have an interdisciplinary background in environmental policy, geography, political economy, and/or ecology. Position requires excellent research and writing skills, with a preference for demonstrated expertise in policy analysis or methods for analyzing case studies. Must be able to work efficiently and independently. Experience with ecosystem services and GIS would be a plus.</p>

<h2>Economist Post-doc</h2>

<p><strong>Stanford University, The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, and The University of Minnesota</strong> together seek an economist for the Natural Capital Project. We are expanding and improving tools to model and map the flow of multiple ecosystem services across land- and seascapes. This position will focus on coastal and marine systems. We seek an imaginative individual for a 1-year position to help us better integrate biophysical models with socio-economic models. The successful candidate will develop, expand and improve economic models for valuation and resource-management purposes that link to production function models of key marine ecosystem services (fisheries, tourism and recreation, shoreline protection, etc.). Together, these models make up InVEST, a spatially-explicit tool that tracks the production and valuation of ecosystem services. The successful candidate will work in a large, interdisciplinary team to create and improve simple, scientifically robust models that have outputs that resonate with stakeholders and decision-makers. Beyond developing and improving models, the successful candidate will also analyze data to parameterize these models in diverse sites and decision-making contexts. The position is based at Stanford University with Gretchen Daily, Mary Ruckelshaus (NatCap Managing Director), and Anne Guerry (NatCap lead scientist).  Steve Polasky (U. Minnesota) will provide additional guidance.  The position will require extensive interaction with interdisciplinary teams and travel.</p> 

<p><strong>Required Qualifications</strong></p>

<ul style="margin-left:20px; list-style-type: disc;">
<li><p>Ph.D. in environmental or agricultural and natural resource economics or a related field </p></li>
<li><p>Experience conducting empirical analyses related to market and non-market valuation </p></li>
<li><p>Experience developing spatially-explicit economic models in the context of natural resource and or land-use management</p></li> 
<li><p>Experience integrating economic models with other biological, physical, or social models </p></li>
<li><p>Experience working with collaborators from diverse backgrounds and capacity and interest to work with interdisciplinary teams</p></li> 
<li><p>Excellent communication and computer skills</p></li> 
</ul>
