<p><a name="coastEng" id="coastEng"></a><b>Coastal Engineer/Nearshore Oceanographer Research Assistant</b> (Application review begins October 3, 2011)

<p><br>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, the University of Minnesota, 
and Stanford University's Woods Institute together seek to fill the position 
of Coastal Engineer/Nearshore Oceanographer Research Assistant for the Natural 
Capital Project (NatCap). We seek a creative individual for a one and a half 
year position to support the development, documentation, and application of 
the Marine InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) 
models for coastal protection. Marine InVEST is a tool developed by NatCap to 
model and map the flow of multiple ecosystem services across seascapes.
</P>
<P>
The Research Assistant will be responsible for helping the Marine InVEST Coastal 
Protection model developers test and validate existing coastal erosion and 
inundation models, support the development of new models, and collate and 
summarize relevant literature. The Research Assistant will also help apply 
Marine InVEST in Galveston Bay, TX, Monterey Bay, CA, and in other locations in 
and outside the US. The Research Assistant may also be involved in the 
development and application of additional Marine InVEST models beyond the 
suite of coastal protection models.
</P>
<p>
This position requires wave, storm surge and/or nearshore circulation modeling 
skills.  In addition, it requires good organizational skills, attention to 
detail, and an exceptional aptitude for teamwork.
</p>
<p>
The candidate should have strong independent research and analytical skills 
and excellent communication skills. Statistical experience is desired so 
that this person can help in developing functional relationships or 
parameterizations.  InVEST is a tool within GIS.  Basic experience with 
GIS is desirable, but not required.
