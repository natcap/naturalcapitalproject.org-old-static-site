<a name="Fisheries" id="Fisheries"></a><h1>Fisheries Post-Doc</h1>
<b>NatCap seeks a creative individual for a 1-2 year post-doc working on climate-habitat-fisheries models and their application.</b><br />
<p>The postdoc will develop a climate-habitat-fisheries model for application in New England and
then generalize it for application to other locations. The modeling project is part of a team effort
to explore how changes in sea surface temperature (and potentially ocean acidification) may
affect coastal and offshore habitats, thus changing distribution of target and bycatch species,
fishing behavior and profits to port communities. The successful applicant must have experience
in quantitative modeling; knowledge of fisheries science and fish-habitat interactions is
preferred. Familiarity with agent- or individual-based models, climate models and integrating
across different types of models is desired. The model is intended to aid in the support of coastal
and marine management and to be general and widely applicable, so applicants must be
passionate about creating simple, elegant, scientifically robust models for decision-making
purposes. The model will be part of the Natural Capital Project's suite of software tools used to
map and value the goods and services from nature that sustain and fulfill human life. The
successful applicant will also support a variety of other NatCap engagements that involve
fisheries, by running or adapting existing InVEST models to meet the needs of the engagement.</p>
<p>The position is located at Stanford University or at the University of Washington. Extensive
interaction with interdisciplinary teams and travel—particularly to New England—are required.</p>
<br />
<h3>Preferred Qualifications</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Ph.D. in fisheries science, quantitative ecology, marine science, or a related field (required)</li>
<li>Experience building and calibrating models, confronting them with limited data and
expressing uncertainty</li>
<li>Experience working with collaborators from diverse backgrounds and interest in working with
interdisciplinary teams</li>
<li>Excellent written and oral communication skills</li>
<li>Strong programming skills</li>
<li>Proficiency in GIS</li>
<li>Research experience in New England fisheries</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p><b>How to Apply:</b> For full consideration, please submit a cover letter, CV, and the names of three
references to Anne Guerry (anne.guerry@stanford.edu) with "Fisheries Scientist Post-doc
Application" listed in the subject line. We will begin reviewing applications November 15th, 2013 and
the position will remain open until filled.

<a name="Economist" id="Economist"></a><h1>Economist Post-Doc</h1>
<b>We seek a creative and talented economist for a post-doctoral research position to advance the development, testing and application of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem service models.</b><br />
<p>The successful candidate will develop, expand, and improve economic models for ecosystem service valuation as part of NatCap's ongoing efforts to provide process-based ecosystem service modeling in support of decision making. To date, these efforts have resulted in <a href="InVEST.html">InVEST</a>, a spatially-explicit tool that tracks the production and valuation of ecosystem services, and <a href="RIOS.html">RIOS</a>, a landscape optimization support tool for watershed services. The postdoc will work in a large, interdisciplinary team to create and improve simple, scientifically-robust models that have outputs that resonate with stakeholders and decision makers.</p>
<p>Beyond general support for valuation work in InVEST and RIOS, the postdoc will work with partners at the Inter-American Development Bank to value the impacts of different road building projects, and also develop new valuation approaches for hydrologic service models in the context of a water fund in Kenya. </p>
<p>Our core team is based in Seattle, Washington, DC, University of Minnesota, and Stanford University, and we have active partners around the globe. This position will be based at either Stanford University or the University of Minnesota, and will be advised by Dr. Gretchen Daily and Dr. Stephen Polasky. It will require extensive interaction with interdisciplinary teams and some travel. </p>
<br />
<h3>Required Qualifications</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Ph.D. in environmental economics or agricultural and natural resource economics, or a related field</li>
<li>Experience developing economic models in the context of natural resource and or land-use management</li>
<li>Experience conducting empirical analyses related to market and non-market valuation</li>
</ul><br />
<h3>Preferred Qualifications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Experience integrating economic models with other biological, physical, or social models</li>
<li>Experience working with collaborators from diverse backgrounds and capacity and interest in working with interdisciplinary teams</li>
<li>Excellent communication skills</li>
