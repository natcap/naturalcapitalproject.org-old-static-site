<p><a href="#ESModeler">Lead Ecosystem Services Modeler</a>
(Application review begins September 6, 2011)</p>
</br>
</br>
<p><a name="ESModeler" id="ESModeler"></a><b>Lead Ecosystem Services Modeler</b> (Application review begins September 6, 2011)
</br>
<P>
We are a partnership among
<B>Stanford University's Woods Institute for the Environment,
University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment,</B> <B>The
Nature Conservancy</B>, and<B> World Wildlife Fund</B> developing
tools to model and map the distribution of biodiversity and the
flow of multiple ecosystem
services across land- and seascapes. We seek a creative and talented
ecologist or economist with strong leadership and communication
skills to advance the development, testing and application of
terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem service models.
</P>
<P>
We are a collaborative group of
researchers and practitioners who seek someone with expertise to
oversee and align the development of terrestrial and freshwater
ecosystem service models, to contribute directly to improvement of
existing models (carbon storage and sequestration, timber and
agricultural production, crop pollination and biodiversity and
methods for representing uncertainty) and to lead the development of
new models (such as non-timber forest product harvest, soil
fertility, livestock production, wind erosion control, forage
production). We seek applicants with diverse experience in the
development and use of models to inform natural resource decisions,
and with a desire to think creatively about a broad set of
biophysical and social processes.</P>
<P>
Our core team is based in
Seattle, Washington, DC and at Stanford, and we have active partners
around the globe. This position is housed at Stanford University and
will be advised by Gretchen Daily and Stephen Polasky.</P>
