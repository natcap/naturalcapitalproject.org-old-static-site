<a name="HydroIntern" id="HydroIntern"></a><h2>Internship Position: Development of the InVEST Seasonal Water Yield Model and Application in Kenya<h2></h2>
<p>The Natural Capital Project is a partnership among Stanford University's Woods Institute for the Environment, University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment, The Nature Conservancy, and World Wildlife Fund developing approaches for modeling ecosystem service change across land- and seascapes. We seek a motivated and diligent intern to support the development of water models for 
the InVEST software and their application in a project in Kenya.</p>
<p>The work will focus on the InVEST seasonal water yield model that is currently in development. The model aims to assess and value seasonal water provisioning services (water supply for irrigation, for hydropower with limited storage, etc.). The physical basis of the model is a five-parameter lumped rainfall-runoff model coupled with a water allocation scheme. The successful candidate will further 
the development of both modules by performing hydrological model testing, and refining the framework for the water resource management module.</p>
<p>This work will inform the ecosystem services assessment of the Tana watershed, Kenya, currently led by a partner organization. Following the model development, the candidate will apply the models to 
the Tana watershed and support NatCap scientists in their work.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Expected Tasks</b></p>
<ul style= "padding-left: 40px;">
<li style="margin-bottom:5px">Perform sensitivity analyses for the physical model and revise the proposed guidance for parameter selection (based on the relationships between calibrated parameters and catchment characteristics)</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:5px">Review the water allocation scheme, compare it with current approaches found in the literature (e.g. WEAP)</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:5px">Develop the practical methodology for the seasonal water model application for water funds</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:5px">Run the model results for the Tana watershed, Kenya</li>
</ul><br />
<p><b>Qualifications</b></p>
<ul style= "padding-left: 40px;">
<li style="margin-bottom:5px">Bachelor's degree in Science or Engineering</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:5px">Experience with hydrological data management (processing time series of streamflow, concentration, etc.)</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:5px">Experience working with collaborators with diverse backgrounds</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:5px">Strong interest in water resources management</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:5px">(Optional) Experience with WEAP, SWAT, or MIKE-SHE</li>
</ul><br />
<p><b>Duration:</b> 2-3 months<br/>
<b>Compensation:</b> Commensurate with Experience</p>
<p><b>How to Apply:</b> Send a cover letter describing your experience and interest, as well as a CV and contact information for two references to <a href="mailto:perrine.hamel@stanford.edu">perrine.hamel@stanford.edu</a> with HYDRO INTERNSHIP in the subject.</p>

<a name="PostDoc" id="PostDoc"></a><h2>Post-doctoral Coastal Engineer/Geophysicist</h2>
<p><b>The Natural Capital Project (NatCap) and the School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences at Stanford University seek a creative individual for a 1-2 year post-doc to develop and apply models quantifying the role that vegetation and reefs play in coastal hazard reduction.</b></p>
<p>The post-doc will work on models for quantifying the role that vegetation and reefs play in coastal hazard reduction. The post-doc will draw upon NatCap's existing models for coastal protection services provided by wetlands, segrasses, coral and oyster reefs, mangroves, and other coastal vegetation. Working with the SIGMA group (SImulations of Geophysical MultiphAse flows) led by Dr. Jenny Suckale, he/she will develop new computational approaches to modeling the interaction between the coastal ecosystem and the incoming flow. The position requires experience in wave, storm surge and/or nearshore circulation modeling, as well as knowledge of coastal erosion and sediment transport processes. Previous experience in developing numerical models for coupled systems of partial differential equations is highly desirable. The post-doc will also work with economists and social scientists to envision and specify novel connections with other disciplines to better value coastal ecosystems for hazard reduction and human well-being benefits. Finally, the post-doc will work closely with a team of software engineers to ensure the quantitative models are accessbile to users of NatCap's suite of ecosystem service models and contribute to the development of new web-based apps for environmental policy-makers. Thus, we seek candidates with broad interests and experience and curiosity for a diversity of fields of knowledge and types of projects.</p>
<p>The successful candidate will be a friendly, intelligent, self-directed individual who is excited about working on collaborative projects for the social good. NatCap models are intended to aid in the support of coastal and marine management and to be general and widely applicable, so applicants must be passionate about creating simple, elegant, scientifically robust models for decision-making purposes. The successful applicant will support a variety of NatCap engagements that involve coastal hazard modeling, including development planning in the Bahamas and prioritization of investments in restoration and conservation in the US.</p>
