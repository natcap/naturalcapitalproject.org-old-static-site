<p><h2>Postdoctoral Researcher - Hydrology</h2></p>

<p>Are you a hydrologist or ecologist with a desire to work in the Stanford community to make game-changing contributions at the nexus of water, development and conservation? Do you have a personal desire to solve some of our biggest environmental problems at local and global scales? Do you thrive in an environment where your ideas are refined by interactions with experts from other fields, and where your work is tested and applied in real-world decisions?</p> 

<p>The Natural Capital Project (NatCap) is a partnership among <strong>Stanford University's Woods Institute for the Environment, University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment, The Nature Conservancy,</strong> and <strong>World Wildlife Fund</strong> developing tools to model and map the distribution of biodiversity and the flow of multiple ecosystem services across land- and seascapes. Our freshwater team is based in Stanford, CA and we have active partners around the globe. We now have an open position for a postdoctoral researcher starting Jan 1st 2012. Come help us make a global impact on major decisions about human well-being, sustainability, and the use of our lands and waters. Duties will include developing, implementing, testing and reporting in peer-reviewed journals our water-related ecosystem services models.</p>
 
<p><strong>Required Qualifications:</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-left:20px; list-style-type: disc;">
<li><p>Ph.D. in hydrology, ecohydrology, agricultural engineering, civil engineering, quantitative/spatial ecology or a related field.</p></li>
<li><p>Established publication record in peer-reviewed journals.</p></li>
<li><p>Strong interest in, and commitment to using science to inform policy.</p></li>
<li><p>Experience in ArcGIS geographic information system and familiarity with MATLAB, Python, FORTRAN, C++, VB, or Java.</p></li>
<li><p>Experience working with collaborators from diverse backgrounds and the capacity and interest to work with interdisciplinary teams.</p></li>
<li><p>Excellent verbal and written communication skills with both technical and non-technical audiences.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Interested applicants are invited to send CV and cover letter by email to Guy Ziv, Scientific Development Lead: <strong><em>guyziv@stanford.edu</em></strong>.</p>

<p>This is a postdoc position based at Stanford. Stanford University is committed to equal opportunity through affirmative action in employment and we are especially eager to identify minority persons and women with appropriate qualifications.</p>

<p><h2>Ecosystem Services Analyst - Postdoctoral Fellow </h2>(Application Review begins November 28, 2011)</p>
<p>We are a partnership among <strong>Stanford University&rsquo;s Woods Institute for the Environment, University  of Minnesota&rsquo;s Institute on the Environment,</strong> <strong>The Nature Conservancy</strong>, and<strong> World  Wildlife Fund</strong> developing tools to model and map the distribution of  biodiversity and the flow of multiple ecosystem services across land- and  seascapes. We seek a creative and talented ecologist or economist with strong  analytical and modeling skills to advance the development, testing and  application of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem service models. </p>
<p>We are a collaborative group of researchers and  practitioners who seek someone with expertise in the development of simple  models through regression analyses and/or simplification of complex models to develop  ranking models for multiple freshwater and terrestrial ecosystem services.  These models will identify where ecosystem service change is most likely to  happen across landscapes. They will be the backbone for decision support tools  that are being tailored for water fund design and permitting requirements in  Latin America and beyond. The successful candidate will first focus on  water-related services such as flood mitigation, water quality regulation, erosion  control and others, then turn to terrestrial services (such as carbon  sequestration, timber production, non-timber forest products, forage  production, livestock production, pollination, etc). We seek applicants with  diverse experience in the development and use of statistical analyses and/or  models to inform natural resource decisions, and with a desire to think  creatively about a broad set of biophysical and social processes.</p>
<p>Our core team is based in Seattle, Washington, DC,  University of Minnesota and at Stanford, and we have active partners around the  globe. This position is housed at Stanford University and will be advised by  Gretchen Daily and Heather Tallis.</p>
