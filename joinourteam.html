<P>
We are a partnership among
<B>Stanford University's Woods Institute for the Environment,
University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment,</B> <B>The
Nature Conservancy</B>, and<B> World Wildlife Fund</B> developing
tools to model and map the distribution of biodiversity and the

terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem service models.

We are a collaborative group of
researchers and practitioners who seek someone with expertise to
oversee and align the development of terrestrial and freshwater
ecosystem service models, to contribute directly to improvement of
existing models (carbon storage and sequestration, timber and
agricultural production, crop pollination and biodiversity and
methods for representing uncertainty) and to lead the development of
new models (such as non-timber forest product harvest, soil
fertility, livestock production, wind erosion control, forage
production). We seek applicants with diverse experience in the
development and use of models to inform natural resource decisions,
and with a desire to think creatively about a broad set of
biophysical and social processes.</P>

<p><a name="GISAnalystMarine" id="GISAnalystMarine"></a><b>GIS Analyst (Marine)</b> (Application review begins July 20, 2011)</p>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, University of Minnesota, 
and Stanford University's Woods Institute for the Environment
together seek to fill the position of GIS Analyst (Marine) for the Natural
Capital Project. Our researchers, based in Seattle and Stanford, are
developing tools to model and map the flow of multiple ecosystem
services across land- and seascapes. The Natural Capital Project is
applying its innovative, spatially-explicit ecosystem-service
quantification and valuation tool, InVEST (Integrated Valuation of
Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) in various locations (e.g. Monterey
Bay, CA; Vancouver Island, Canada; Belize)   The successful applicant
will work in a team to adapt and apply the InVEST ecosystem-service
models and will then synthesize these results in order to best inform
policy at our demonstration sites.  We seek a creative individual to
support further development, documentation, maintenance, and
application of the Marine InVEST models.</P>
<p>The GIS Analyst will be located in Palo Alto, CA or Seattle, WA</p>
