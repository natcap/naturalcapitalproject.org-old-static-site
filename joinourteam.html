<a name="PostDoc" id="PostDoc"></a><h1>Post-Doctoral Opportunity In Boreal Forest Ecosystem Services</h1>
<p>We are seeking applications for a post-doctoral associate in ecosystem services 
and/or environmental economics to work with Dr. Peter Reich (Department of Forest Resources) and NatCap Director Dr. Steve Polasky (Departments of Applied Economics and Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior) at University of Minnesota. Both Reich and Polasky are also Fellows of the Institute on the Environment at UMN, our partner, which is a major supporter of this project. This research will be part of, and extend, both a long-running boreal forest ecosystem science project (led by Reich) and environmental economics/ecosystem services work (led by Polasky). Additionally, the project will interface with ongoing biodiversity-ecosystem services synthesis projects Reich is involved in. The appointment is for one year with potential for renewal depending on performance, to begin as soon as possible. The specific research project to be conducted will depend on the interests of the successful applicant, however its focus will 
be on ecosystem services, the factors contributing to their quantity and quality, their value to society, and how these may evolve under multiple global change drivers.</p><br/>
<h3>Desired Qualifications</h3>
<p>Ph.D. in ecosystem ecology, natural resources ecology, economics, or other relevant field. Interest in bridging ecological and economic sciences.</p><br/>
<h3>Prefered Qualifications</h3>
<p>Experience in bridging ecological and economic
sciences.</p><br/>
