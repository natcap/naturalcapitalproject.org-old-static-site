</p>
<p><a name="coastEng" id="coastEng"></a><b>Coastal Engineer/Nearshore Oceanographer Research Assistant</b> (Application review begins October 3, 2011)
<p><br>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, the University of Minnesota, 
and Stanford University's Woods Institute together seek to fill the position 
of Coastal Engineer/Nearshore Oceanographer Research Assistant for the Natural 
Capital Project (NatCap). We seek a creative individual for a one and a half 
year position to support the development, documentation, and application of 
the Marine InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) 
models for coastal protection. Marine InVEST is a tool developed by NatCap to 
model and map the flow of multiple ecosystem services across seascapes.</P>
<P>
The Research Assistant will be responsible for helping the Marine InVEST Coastal 
Protection model developers test and validate existing coastal erosion and 
inundation models, support the development of new models, and collate and 
summarize relevant literature. The Research Assistant will also help apply 
Marine InVEST in Galveston Bay, TX, Monterey Bay, CA, and in other locations in 
and outside the US. The Research Assistant may also be involved in the 
development and application of additional Marine InVEST models beyond the 
suite of coastal protection models.</P>
<p>
This position requires wave, storm surge and/or nearshore circulation modeling 
skills.  In addition, it requires good organizational skills, attention to 
detail, and an exceptional aptitude for teamwork.</p>
<p>
The candidate should have strong independent research and analytical skills 
and excellent communication skills. Statistical experience is desired so 
that this person can help in developing functional relationships or 
parameterizations.  InVEST is a tool within GIS.  Basic experience with 
GIS is desirable, but not required.</p>

<p><strong><a name="ecosyst5emservicesanalyst" id="ecosystemservicesanalyst"></a> Ecosystem Services Analyst - Postdoctoral Fellow </strong>(Application Review begins November 28, 2011)</p>
<p>We are a partnership among <strong>Stanford University&rsquo;s Woods Institute for the Environment, University  of Minnesota&rsquo;s Institute on the Environment,</strong> <strong>The Nature Conservancy</strong>, and<strong> World  Wildlife Fund</strong> developing tools to model and map the distribution of  biodiversity and the flow of multiple ecosystem services across land- and  seascapes. We seek a creative and talented ecologist or economist with strong  analytical and modeling skills to advance the development, testing and  application of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem service models. </p>
<p>We are a collaborative group of researchers and  practitioners who seek someone with expertise in the development of simple  models through regression analyses and/or simplification of complex models to develop  ranking models for multiple freshwater and terrestrial ecosystem services.  These models will identify where ecosystem service change is most likely to  happen across landscapes. They will be the backbone for decision support tools  that are being tailored for water fund design and permitting requirements in  Latin America and beyond. The successful candidate will first focus on  water-related services such as flood mitigation, water quality regulation, erosion  control and others, then turn to terrestrial services (such as carbon  sequestration, timber production, non-timber forest products, forage  production, livestock production, pollination, etc). We seek applicants with  diverse experience in the development and use of statistical analyses and/or  models to inform natural resource decisions, and with a desire to think  creatively about a broad set of biophysical and social processes.</p>
<p>Our core team is based in Seattle, Washington, DC,  University of Minnesota and at Stanford, and we have active partners around the  globe. This position is housed at Stanford University and will be advised by  Gretchen Daily and Heather Tallis.</p>
