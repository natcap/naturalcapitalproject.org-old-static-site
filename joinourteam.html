<h1>Open Positions</h1>
<p>We are a partnership among Stanford University's Woods Institute for the Environment, University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment, The Nature Conservancy, and World Wildlife Fund, developing approaches and tools to model and map the distribution of biodiversity and the flow of multiple ecosystem services across land- and seascapes.</p>
<p> There are currently several open positions at The Natural Capital Project:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><a href="#Software">Software Engineer </a></li>

<a name="Software" id="Software"></a>
<h1>Software Engineer</h1>
<p>The Software Engineer will support the development of existing and new software that the Natural Capital Project uses to assist policy makers in making science based decisions about environmental policies.  This includes the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) toolkit, RIOS (Resource Investment Optimization System) a land planning software suite, and a host of new online software components under development.  Day to day development involves implementing mathematical models of environmental services with a focus on correctness, usability, and performance.  Other traditional engineer job functions include developing test suites, implementing new features on existing models, user support, and supporting internal project management tools for the development team.</p>

<p>The successful candidate will be a friendly, intelligent, self-directed individual who is passionate about working on collaborative software projects for the social good.
