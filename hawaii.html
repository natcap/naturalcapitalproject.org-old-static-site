<h1>Hawaiian Islands, USA</h1>

<p>Hawai'i is a microcosm of important forces at play worldwide.
With a rapidly growing population and intensifying development
pressure, the future of Hawai'i's forests and agricultural lands is in
question. Today, diverse leaders across the public, private, and
non-profit sectors in Hawai'i are mobilizing to incorporate the values
of natural capital into land use and policy decisions. Under the
state's ecosystem services resolution and climate bill, passed in 2006
and 2007 respectively, the Natural Capital Project is designing models
that we hope can inform future efforts in the U.S. and across the world.</p>
<br />
<h2>Landowners Looking for New, Sustainable Business Models</h2>
<br />
<p>
Development pressure is leading to rising land prices, and farm, ranch,
and forest landowners are looking for new business models that are
financially viable and ecologically sustainable so productive lands
will be passed on to future generations. </p>
<p>In addition, invasive species continue to disrupt native
ecosystems while land managers face escalating control costs. Climate
change is sure to affect this island state through sea level rise and
other impacts. Addressing these multiple threats will require
innovative partnerships to cultivate the ecological, economic,
cultural, and institutional knowledge to make meaningful change. </p>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/hi04.jpg" alt="© Gretchen Daily - Hanalei Kalo" height="153" width="230" /> </div>
<p>Our goal is a future in which Hawai'i's unique ecosystems
support the needs and aspirations of its communities: clean drinking
water, productive farming and ranching lands, healthy coral reef and
coastal systems, habitat for Hawai'i's unique native plants and
animals, forests sequestering carbon to mitigate climate change, and
more. Building on our work in Hawai'i, we aim to create a model for
integrating ecosystem services into decision-making that can inform
future efforts in the United States and around the world. </p>
<br />
<h2>Launching Payment Programs for Ecosystem Services</h2>
<br />
<p>
Creating financial incentives for ecosystem services is key to making
conservation economically attractive and commonplace. Building upon
Hawai'i's climate legislation, we are bringing together buyers and
sellers for a pilot forest carbon offset project. This project will
include land-based sequestration as a mitigation measure in Hawai'i's
approach to achieving emissions reductions.
</p>
<br />
<h2>Mapping and Valuing Ecosystem Services In Land Management</h2>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/hi02.jpg" alt="© Liba Pejchar - Mauna Kea, Hawai'i" height="235" width="220" /> </div>
<p>We are collaborating with <a href="http://www.ksbe.edu/" target="_blank">Kamehameha Schools (KS)</a> to test
the InVEST software tool on a key landholding on the north shore of
O'ahu. KS is facing important land use decisions in its current
community planning effort. Reconnecting people to the land through
cultural and educational opportunities is core to KS's mission, and we
are developing new models to include these values in InVEST. Building
from this pilot, we will work with KS, government agencies, and other
major landowners to tailor InVEST to their needs and decision-making. </p>
<br />
<br />
<h2>Advancing Scientific Frontiers: Koa forest restoration,
water-related ecosystem services</h2>
<br />
<p>We are working with private landowners to develop ecological
and economic approaches for protecting and restoring biodiversity and
ecosystem services, and in ways that are economically attractive. Our
major focus is on opportunities to restore native koa tree cover for
its diverse economic, ecological, and cultural benefits. We are also
leading efforts to generate new scientific knowledge about the
connections between land use and the provision of hydrologic services.
This knowledge will be critical to informing the design of institutions
and payment programs to protect these services. </p>
<br />
<h2>Providing Input Into Policy Discussions </h2>
<br />
<p>County and state leaders are increasingly recognizing the
importance of ecosystem services and we are working with them and
colleagues at <a href="http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/hawaii/" target="_blank">The Nature Conservancy's Hawai'i Program</a>
to build new incentives and institutions that reward landowners for the
ecosystem services that their lands provide to the public. Key policy
opportunities include House Bill 226 mandating a reduction of the
state's greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. </p>

<p><b>InVEST Workshop with Kamehameha Schools Held in
Honolulu October 8-11, 2007</b></p>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/hi03.jpg" alt="© Josh Goldstein - North Shore Oahu, Hawaii" height="249" width="230" /> </div>
<p>The Natural Capital Project team and collaborators from the
National Center for Ecological Assessment and Synthesis (<a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">NCEAS</a>)
met with Kamehameha Schools to launch on-the-ground ecosystem services
mapping and modeling, using <a href="InVEST.html">InVEST</a>.
We aim to illuminate the linkages, trade offs, and potential outcomes
of 10 alternative land management scenarios on 26,000 acres for carbon
sequestration, agricultural production, hydrological services,
non-timber forest products, cultural and educational services, and
biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Early Results</h2>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"></div>
<p><b>Developed business models for conservation,</b>
focused on win-win opportunities for private ranchers to restore native
koa forest, providing an attractive revenue stream as well as benefits
for endangered species and ecosystem services.</p>
<p><b>Initiated the design of a carbon sequestration
project,</b> focused on restoration of native forest, by bringing
together potential buyers and sellers from across the state in the
context of Hawai'i's climate bill.</p>
<p><b>Mapping and valuing ecosystem services,</b>
using <a href="InVEST.html">InVEST</a> with the
Land Assets Division of Kamehameha Schools, the largest private
landowner in Hawai'i.</p>
<p><b>Working with policy-makers on new incentives:</b>
Served as lead members of the steering committee responding to House
Concurrent Resolution 200 (calling for ecosystem service payments).</p>
<p><b>House Speaker Calvin Say</b> participated in
our symposium on ecosystem services in Honolulu, and has offered his
support of our policy work. </p>

<p><b>Paradise Found: Paying ranchers to restore Hawaii's
great forests</b></p>
<p><a href="http://storybank.stanford.edu/stories/paradise-found-paying-ranchers-restore-hawaiis-great-forests" target="_blank"><i>Stanford StoryBank,</i> April
20, 2009</a></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Partly as a result of the EVP [<a href="http://woods.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/evp.php" target="_blank">Woods
Institute Environmental Venture Project Grant</a>] and a series
of concurrent, related efforts, the InVEST software system has been
developed for mapping and valuing natural capital,&#8217; Daily explained.
&#8216;We're now testing and refining the software for major resource
decisions in landscapes around the world&#8212;in China, Colombia, Ecuador,
Tanzania, California, Hawaii, and Oregon. There is tremendous demand
for this tool and approach to guide strategic investment in natural
capital. The time is ripe in both the business and policy arenas.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Land Conservation Efforts Offer Financial Rewards for

<p>&#8220;Making conservation pay is a critical step toward encouraging
restoration of private, working lands, the authors concluded. &#8216;Finding
economically viable means of reforesting degraded pastureland is
relevant far beyond Hawaii, particularly in the tropics.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
