<p>Scanning the busy agenda for this week's Fortune Brainstorm Green, I'm struck by the opening and closing sessions of the first day. Focusing these highly visible sessions on the economics of conservation is telling. Indeed, how businesses, financial institutions and governments account for nature as a material asset has become the hottest sustainability topic of 2013.</p>

<p>Since joining The Nature Conservancy, and over the course of writing Nature's Fortune: How Business and Society Thrive by Investing in Nature, I've been fortunate to benefit from the perspectives and advice of many leaders of the environmental community. To continue the conversation on the ideas in Nature's Fortune, I recently spoke with leading conservationists, CEOs, scientists, academics and activists about the environmental movement -- what's working well, what we could do better and what they see as the biggest challenges and opportunities ahead.</p>

<p>Most of us think of nature as being free, or priceless. Yet, recent disasters like Superstorm Sandy show just how valuable nature is, such as for protecting coastal communities from inundation. Can we quantify nature's value in ways that help us make important decisions?</p>

<p>A new analysis by dozens of scientists provides a useful update on measured and anticipated impacts of human-driven climate change on ecosystems from western forests to coastal waters. The report, "Impacts of Climate Change on Biodiversity, Ecosystems, and Ecosystem Services," is one of a suite of studies feeding into what will be the third National Climate Assessment, an overarching analysis of impacts on everything from transportation systems to public health. </p>

<p>Water funds are taking off like a wildfire in Latin America. But like a wildfire, they run the risk of burning too hot and too fast to help the ecology (and the people) in the system. The rapid expansion of water funds in latitudes south has presented some challenges for The Nature Conservancy and its partners, which are trying to make the most of a potentially great tool for bringing nature's value into the real economy.</p>

<p>With 9 billion people expected to be alive in 2050, researchers are running out of time to develop new ways to feed them sustainably. But an analysis published today in Nature suggests that strategies already exist that could shrink the 'yield gap' — which they define as the difference between attainable and actual yields of food crops. Assembling the most comprehensive global data set of crop yields and fertilizer use yet produced, the study authors show that yield increases of 45–70% are possible for most crops through improved nutrient management and increased use of irrigation.</p>

New Scientist - by Sara Reardon - <em>June 16, 2012<p> Featuring Gretchen Daily and Peter Kareiva</p></em>
<p> When appeals to an environmental
conscience cannot motivate
governments to conserve their
natural resources, a swift kick in the
wallet may. That's the idea behind a
strategy expected to be discussed at the
Rio+20 United Nations Conference on
Sustainable Development next week.
Gaining traction are projects to
quantify the value of "services"
provided to us by oceans, forests and
other ecosystems, determine the
economic hit to a nation once they
run out, and then paying would-be
consumers to conserve those assets.
And, with characteristic pragmatism,
China is leading the experiment.</p>

    <p><strong>A damming assessment of Mekong development</strong></p>

    <p><em>Dams on tributaries worse for fish than those on the main river.</em></p>

    <p>Nature, March 5th, 2012 (link below)</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/a-damming-assessment-of-mekong-development-1.10166">http://www.nature.com/news/a-damming-assessment-of-mekong-development-1.10166</a></p>

    <p>Dams on the tributaries of the Mekong River could have a greater negative effect on fish biodiversity and food security than those on the main river, researchers say.</p>

    <p>Hydropower developments on Mekong tributaries are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as their counterparts on the main river. "Most of the attention has been on proposed dams on the Mekong mainstream, such as the highly controversial Xayaburi dam in Laos," says lead author Guy Ziv, an environmental scientist now at Stanford University in California. "The impact of tributary dams is little studied."</p>

    <p>The findings, published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, "point to a desperate need to reconsider hydropower development in the entire Mekong River basin", says Ame Trandem, the Southeast Asia programme director for the environmental group International Rivers in Bangkok.</p>

    <p>With a watershed of 800,000 square kilometres, the Mekong River basin supports the world's largest inland fishery and is home to 65 million people in six countries: China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. "Most of the people are poor and get 81% of their protein from subsistence fisheries," says Ziv.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Nine watersheds tumble into Cauca Valley, a region in the southwest of Colombia sandwiched between two of the Colombia Andean mountain chains. For centuries, its richness has attracted humans, who exploited the valley's resources first for agriculture and stockbreeding, and later for hydroelectric power generation. Today, sugar cane production dominates the valley's industry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'There are many stresses from water use. The sugar cane sector is thirsty, but the people who live there also need it for daily activities and for drinking water,' says Alejandro Calvache, a water fund specialist at The Nature Conservancy, based in Cartagena, Columbia. TNC, in collaboration with the sugar cane growers' association, the regional environmental authority and several grassroots organizations, is building a water fund that will oversee a massive program of reforestation, water protection, soil improvements, education and training. By investing in the region's environmental services, the project, which is called 'Agua Por La Vida y la Sostenibilidad' meaning 'Water for Life and sustainability' aims to lessen climate change impacts and threats to biodiversity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Water funds exist globally to conserve watersheds, but this is one of the first to include climate change modelling to help direct investments. The International Center for Tropical Agriculture, a research institute in Columbia, is modelling scenarios to determine the effects of climate change on local water resources. These scenarios are then fed into a computer-based decision-making tool called InVEST, which has been developed by the Natural Capital Project, a partnership between TNC, Stanford University and the World Wildlife Fund. InVEST identifies the areas where climate change is unlikely to threaten activities the water fund has been invested in such as promoting the reforestation of a hillside or teaching eco-friendly cattle-ranching practices and their returns. 'Traditionally, conservation has pulled on people's heart-strings,' says Heather Tallis, lead scientist at Natural Capital. 'We try to appeal to people's lifeblood, like drinking water.'&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Just documenting diversity doesn't guarantee that a place becomes a park. Selecting good bits requires understanding how critters use space and weighing competing claims for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One recent approach looks to double the punch of the case for setting aside land by identifying biodiverse places that also provide documented environmental services, says Taylor Ricketts, who heads the World Wildlife Fund's Conservation Science Program, based in Washington, D.C. Though the two don't match tidily, Ricketts has found a few natural sweet spots important for their variety of living things and for such boons as storing abundant carbon or collecting water.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The challenge of determining, measuring, and communicating the values of environmental services is being addressed through efforts such as the Natural Capital Project...to develop tools for facilitating incorporation of natural capital (i.e., valuation of environmental services) into decision making. Their first tool, InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs), can model and map the delivery, distribution, and economic value of environmental services into the future. InVEST allows users to visualize the impacts of their potential decisions, which enables identification of tradeoffs among environmental, economic, and social benefits. This tool has already been applied successfully using stakeholder defined scenarios to predict changes in land use and associated tradeoffs in the Willamette Valley, Oregon (Nelson et al., 2009). Although InVEST was initially focused on terrestrial ecosystems, it is now being applied to coastal and marine ecosystems to provide maps and projections of environmental services under different management alternatives for issues, such as tradeoffs associated with large-scale implementation of desalination plants in California (Ruckelshaus and Guerry, 2009). Marine InVEST
offers a promising new approach for incorporating scientific information about environmental services into decision making and resource management.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The overall lesson is that what looks beneficial only does so because the profits are retained by the private sector, while the problems are spread out across society at large, appearing on no specific balance sheet. Ecosystem-services researchers are now providing such balance sheets in more and more of the world. Poor countries such as South Africa and Tanzania have realised that if they study the provision of such services sensibly, they can make more rational decisions and avoid some of the costly mistakes made by those places that have already developed. To this end, the Natural Capital Project, a group based at Stanford University, California, has developed a suite of computer programs called InVEST, which will analyse and map ecosystem services. InVEST allows farmers, landowners and government officials to make better-informed decisions about the current and future costs of an activity.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We must translate our actions—and the intended or unintended results—into environmental values we can compare with other values, such as increased income or jobs. Economists have already made great progress in valuing certain environmental benefits. For example, we can infer the value of nature to homeowners by analyzing how housing prices increase with access to lakes, a scenic view or other environmental amenities. And, we must bring the values of nature to bear in our decision-making processes. Innovative public policies, such as incentive-based regulations, and private initiatives, such as environmental certification, harness market forces for environmental protection, showing it is possible to protect the environment—even in a rising economy.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;If nature were being protected for her own sake, there would be no worry. But around the world nature is being liquidated—at accelerating rates. Moreover, in rich and poor countries alike, conservation is often seen as the passion of a small minority, in conflict with most people's needs and aspirations. Changing this situation requires two things: first, shining a light on nature's tremendous but often invisible values; and second, demonstrating how these values can be mainstreamed into resource decisions to benefit both people and nature.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;GRETCHEN DAILY: 'Since the dawn of humanity, people have been a small-time force on the planet. Except for matters of local scarcity, nature's life support systems were free and abundant. We never had to think about the dangers of running out of fertile soil, clean water, or pollinators (such as bees, birds, and bats) that made it possible to reap a harvest; an ozone layer to shield us from ultraviolet radiation; or forests to soak up precipitation and control flooding. Before the late 20th century, anyone living in Louisiana could take for granted that the barrier islands off the coast would help protect them from storms.</p>

<p>Today, that has changed. Shoreline ecosystems have been so eroded by development that many communities were more vulnerable to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and to the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. The world's population is close to 7 billion now, and many people in emerging countries hope to live like the Americans they see on television shows. They're going to demand more protein, such as beef or chicken, in their diets, which will require a sixfold increase in the amount of grain consumed per capita. That would require much more arable land than we have on the planet, even if we cut down all the remaining natural forests. And if we did do that, the increase in greenhouse gases would make the risks of climate change far worse.</p>

<p>In other words, humanity is rapidly liquidating its own long-term life support systems. And we've only just begun to pay the price. Anywhere you look, there is suddenly a zero-sum game when it comes to land, water, or other key natural resources. We can't afford to go on treating nature like an all-you-can-eat buffet. We need to recognize that there are a ton of people sitting around this one little table, and we've got to establish both prices and table manners to sustain the bounty.'&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Economists have been working on attaching monetary value to components of natural systems since at least the 1960s, evaluating the cost of damage caused by oil spills, for example. But environmental activists and conservationists didn't pay this work much attention. Many felt that nature should be saved not for it price, but for its own sake...Daily focuses much of her energy on the Natural Capital Project, a joint effort she brokered between Stanford, the conservation group WWF and the Nature Conservancy. The project, which she co-directs, is developing a software system to help people weigh up the value of land in terms of ecosystem services, alongside its value for building houses or other development. Maps of an area are layered with information — much of which can be displayed in dollars — such as which parts of the landscape are best for filtering water, where the real-estate is most valuable, where the most carbon can be stored and where the biodiversity is highest. Such maps could help governmental organizations evaluate, for example, the cost of building on land that provides free water filtration if the development would then require the construction of a costly water plant. 'We can bring about this transformation if we supply tools that make it easy for decision-makers to compare alternative scenarios,' she says.&rdquo;</p>

Last September...several Chinese government-affiliated scientists met with a team from the Natural Capital Project - a year-old partnership between Stanford University, The Nature Conservancy and WWF. The project has developed mapping and modeling software to pinpoint landscapes where conservation makes the most sense, a tool that has great potential to help the Chinese government fine-tune its concept of preserving 'ecological function zones.'&rdquo;</p>
