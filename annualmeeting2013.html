<h1>NatCap Annual Meeting & InVEST Training</h1>

The Natural Capital Project (NatCap) cordially invites you to attend our Annual Meeting and InVEST Training at Stanford University from March 13-15, 2013. The meeting is designed for new and existing users of the Natural Capital Project's Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) software suite.  It will provide a comprehensive hands-on training in our approach and tools, as well as provide an opportunity for InVEST users, and others interested in ecosystem services mapping and valuation, to share their work and experiences. Mapping and modeling ecosystem services can help uncover hidden costs and benefits of different natural resource management options, highlighting key linkages between humans and the ecosystems on which we depend.  NatCap has developed an approach and decision support tool (InVEST) that allows nature's benefits to be incorporated into decision-making.  InVEST models have been used in more than 20 significant policy applications worldwide—from the designation of ecosystem function conservation areas in China, to the establishment of water funds in Latin America, to marine spatial planning in Belize.</p>
<p>The InVEST Annual Meeting & Training will begin with an introduction to the Natural Capital Project's approach to ecosystem service valuation and the InVEST software suite, as well as some general guidance on how our approach can be applied in various decision-making contexts. The rest of the training will include an interactive mapping exercise to explore tradeoffs, demonstrations of a number of InVEST models using sample data to generate outputs, and time for attendees to run the models with their own data if desired. Participants also are invited to showcase their work and share stories with others conducting ecosystem services modeling and valuation projects around the world in an informal poster session during happy hour!</p>
<p>Last year, over 100 participants joined in our inaugural annual meeting and InVEST training, and this year we anticipate an even greater turnout, so sign up soon!</p>
