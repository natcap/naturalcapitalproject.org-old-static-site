<p>Peter Kareiva had come to answer for his truths.</p>

<p>Settling at the head of a long table ringed by young researchers new to the policy world, Kareiva, chief scientist of the Nature Conservancy, the world's largest environmental organization, cracked open a beer. After a long day mentoring at the group's headquarters, an eight-story box nestled in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, he was ready for some sparring.</p>

<p>The scientists had read Kareiva's recent essay, which takes environmentalists to task. The data couldn't bear out their piety, he wrote. Nature is often resilient, not fragile. There is no wilderness unspoiled by man. Thoreau was a townie. Conservation, by many measures, is failing. If it is to survive, it has to change.</p>

<p>Environmental policy is something of a family business for Mary Ruckelshaus. Her father, the attorney William Ruckelshaus, became the first administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, when she was in fourth grade, and returned for a second term in the mid-1980s. "We had a lot of great dinner table discussions," she recalls, but her own interest was in science more than legal policy. A Ph.D. in biology led her to Seattle, where she worked on salmon and orca recovery for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In 2010 she became managing director of the Natural Capital Project, an environmental think tank based at Stanford University. Advancing ideas developed by co-founder Gretchen Daily in her groundbreaking books Nature's Services and <em>The New Economy of Nature</em>, the project's team of biologists, economists, data analysts, and legal scholars collaborates with governments and NGOs to fairly value ecosystem services</p>


<p><strong><a href="">How to put a value on oil damaged life in the gulf</a></strong><br/>
NPR News - <em>November 11, 2011</em><br/>
<em>Featuring Mary Ruckelshaus, Managing Director of the Natural Capital Project</em></p>

<p>A law passed after the Exxon Valdez oil spill requires the government to assess the biological damage from big spills so fines can be fixed and damage paid for. The National Academy of Sciences has a report describing the methods and metrics of determining the "ecosystem services" that have been lost due to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<em>Featuring Peter Kareiva, one of the founders and Directors of the Natural Capital Project</em></p>

<p>The Nature Conservancy's chief scientist, Peter Kareiva, says it's time for conservationists to stop neglecting urban areas. The reason is simple: If conservation is to build the support it needs, it must energize young urban dwellers, who now make up most of the world.</p>

    <p><strong>A damming assessment of Mekong development</strong></p>

    <p><em>Dams on tributaries worse for fish than those on the main river.</em></p>

    <p>Nature, March 5th, 2012 (link below)</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/a-damming-assessment-of-mekong-development-1.10166">http://www.nature.com/news/a-damming-assessment-of-mekong-development-1.10166</a></p>

    <p>Dams on the tributaries of the Mekong River could have a greater negative effect on fish biodiversity and food security than those on the main river, researchers say.</p>

    <p>Hydropower developments on Mekong tributaries are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as their counterparts on the main river. "Most of the attention has been on proposed dams on the Mekong mainstream, such as the highly controversial Xayaburi dam in Laos," says lead author Guy Ziv, an environmental scientist now at Stanford University in California. "The impact of tributary dams is little studied."</p>

    <p>The findings, published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, "point to a desperate need to reconsider hydropower development in the entire Mekong River basin", says Ame Trandem, the Southeast Asia programme director for the environmental group International Rivers in Bangkok.</p>

    <p>With a watershed of 800,000 square kilometres, the Mekong River basin supports the world's largest inland fishery and is home to 65 million people in six countries: China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. "Most of the people are poor and get 81% of their protein from subsistence fisheries," says Ziv.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Nine watersheds tumble into Cauca Valley, a region in the southwest of Colombia sandwiched between two of the Colombia Andean mountain chains. For centuries, its richness has attracted humans, who exploited the valley's resources first for agriculture and stockbreeding, and later for hydroelectric power generation. Today, sugar cane production dominates the valley's industry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'There are many stresses from water use. The sugar cane sector is thirsty, but the people who live there also need it for daily activities and for drinking water,' says Alejandro Calvache, a water fund specialist at The Nature Conservancy, based in Cartagena, Columbia. TNC, in collaboration with the sugar cane growers' association, the regional environmental authority and several grassroots organizations, is building a water fund that will oversee a massive program of reforestation, water protection, soil improvements, education and training. By investing in the region's environmental services, the project, which is called 'Agua Por La Vida y la Sostenibilidad' meaning 'Water for Life and sustainability' aims to lessen climate change impacts and threats to biodiversity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Water funds exist globally to conserve watersheds, but this is one of the first to include climate change modelling to help direct investments. The International Center for Tropical Agriculture, a research institute in Columbia, is modelling scenarios to determine the effects of climate change on local water resources. These scenarios are then fed into a computer-based decision-making tool called InVEST, which has been developed by the Natural Capital Project, a partnership between TNC, Stanford University and the World Wildlife Fund. InVEST identifies the areas where climate change is unlikely to threaten activities the water fund has been invested in such as promoting the reforestation of a hillside or teaching eco-friendly cattle-ranching practices and their returns. 'Traditionally, conservation has pulled on people's heart-strings,' says Heather Tallis, lead scientist at Natural Capital. 'We try to appeal to people's lifeblood, like drinking water.'&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Just documenting diversity doesn't guarantee that a place becomes a park. Selecting good bits requires understanding how critters use space and weighing competing claims for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One recent approach looks to double the punch of the case for setting aside land by identifying biodiverse places that also provide documented environmental services, says Taylor Ricketts, who heads the World Wildlife Fund's Conservation Science Program, based in Washington, D.C. Though the two don't match tidily, Ricketts has found a few natural sweet spots important for their variety of living things and for such boons as storing abundant carbon or collecting water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Natural Capital Project...is refining software to allow fine-scale analyses, and Tanzania, the state of Hawaii and others are already using the software.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The challenge of determining, measuring, and communicating the values of environmental services is being addressed through efforts such as the Natural Capital Project...to develop tools for facilitating incorporation of natural capital (i.e., valuation of environmental services) into decision making. Their first tool, InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs), can model and map the delivery, distribution, and economic value of environmental services into the future. InVEST allows users to visualize the impacts of their potential decisions, which enables identification of tradeoffs among environmental, economic, and social benefits. This tool has already been applied successfully using stakeholder defined scenarios to predict changes in land use and associated tradeoffs in the Willamette Valley, Oregon (Nelson et al., 2009). Although InVEST was initially focused on terrestrial ecosystems, it is now being applied to coastal and marine ecosystems to provide maps and projections of environmental services under different management alternatives for issues, such as tradeoffs associated with large-scale implementation of desalination plants in California (Ruckelshaus and Guerry, 2009). Marine InVEST
offers a promising new approach for incorporating scientific information about environmental services into decision making and resource management.&rdquo;</p>
