<p>Extending across the northern Andes Mountains, including much
of Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, and the northern tip of Peru, as
well as Panama, Costa Rica, and the southern tip of Nicaragua, the
Northern Andes and Southern Central America (NASCA) region is home to
over 20% of the world's biodiversity. Defined by similar ecology, the
region encompasses moist and dry tropical forests, high altitude
grasslands (p&aacuteramo), urban metropolises, rivers, rural landscapes, and
a vast array of flora and fauna. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to restricted budgets and limited
resources, the official national protected areas in the region, which
include much of the forests and p&aacuteramo, are not well enforced and
protected. In addition, biodiversity and environmental services data is
limited and/or not accessible for government decision-making and use.
Nature Conservancy staff and partners in the NASCA region are using <a href="../InVEST.html">InVEST</a> to map ecosystem
services to generate information that can guide and inform
decision-making. </p>

<h2>Using Return on Investment for Conservation Action: Targeting Water Fund
Investments</h2>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="../images/nta_15.jpg" alt="© TNC-Northern Tropical Andes (Bridget Besaw and Diego Ochoa)" height="144" width="250" /> </div>
<p>Water fund projects have proliferated in NASCA thanks to TNC
leadership and innovation. Water funds essentially use a sustainable
finance mechanism for watershed conservation. Water users make
voluntary financial contributions into a fund that is invested,
providing a long term revenue source for conservation of the watershed.
Contributors are motivated by the fact that watershed conservation will
provide water purification and regulation services at lower cost than
other forms of treatment and flow regulation such as through built
infrastructure.</p>
<p>In order to value water services from the watershed, identify
priority sites for investment in the watersheds to secure those
services, and set up monitoring programs (identification of priority
sites for monitoring) for these water funds, feasibility and design
studies were developed and run with technical support from NASCA
Science and Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (<a href="http://www.ciat.cgiar.org/">CIAT</a>).</p>
<p><a href="../InVEST.html">InVEST</a>, SWAT
(Soil and Water Assessment Tool), and FIESTA (Fog Interception for the
Enhancement of Stream flow in Tropical Areas) models were run using
data from the watershed in the East Cauca Valley in Colombia, the site
of a recent water fund project (see publication list). Model results
will help determine critical areas in the watershed for immediate water
fund investments. In addition, comparison of model results will help
inform the use of InVEST for water fund projects throughout the region.
</p>
<p>Over time, TNC staff hope to use <a href="../InVEST.html">InVEST</a>
to build scenarios to determine the impacts from climate change on the
water resources critical for the water fund projects.

<h2>Water Fund Investments in Latin America</h2>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="../images/cc/WF-map.jpg" alt="Water Funds Map" /></div>
<p>
The Natural Capital Project is working with the Latin America Water Funds Platform (a partnership among The Nature Conservancy, the Inter-American Development Bank, GEF and FEMSA) to develop a science-based software tool that will standardize water fund investment design.  Water is one of the scarcest resources on the planet, and pressures on it will only grow as the human population expands and climate changes. Latin America is making a major effort to address this issue through development of a new conservation financing mechanism known as water funds. The goal of these funds is to improve the management of watersheds, the green infrastructure that supplies, regulates, and cleans water.</p>
<p>Water funds are a finance mechanism for watershed conservation and provision of clean, ample water. Beneficiaries of a watershed make financial contributions to a fund that is used to promote conservation activities including protection, restoration, and best management practices in crop and pasture lands. Water funds work when these activities supply water, and provide purification and regulation services at lower costs than other forms of treatment and flow regulation such as dams and water treatment plants.</p>
<p>In 2011 the Latin American Water Funds Partnership committed to developing 32 new water funds in Latin America over 5 years, pledging $27 million to restore over 7 million acres of watersheds (see map above). The Natural Capital project is working with this partnership to develop water funds that represent the interests of multiple stakeholders and maximize the water-related benefits of improved land management. Our work builds on the experiences of existing water funds to develop a standardized and flexible approach to water fund design and investment.  Our approach values the environmental returns on watershed investments through hydrological models while accounting for preferences and requirements of stakeholders.  Our work in the Cauca Valley has improved the return on investment in their water fund, as watershed conservation efforts are now able to choose the conservation activities and areas for investment to yield the greatest improvements to water quality.</p>
<br />
<h2>RIOS: Resource Investment Optimization System</h2>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="../images/cc/RIOS-IP.jpg" alt="Investment portfolio" /></div>
<p>RIOS is a water funds development tool co-designed with users to improve returns from conservation investments based on a combination of biophysical, social and economic data. The tool has been tested in several emerging water funds across Latin America and has proven useful for managers and flexible enough to apply in different environmental, social, and legal contexts.  RIOS is free and designed for companies, consultants, government agencies or non-government organizations to use in the development of water fund investments. It provides decision makers with the best locations on a landscape to spend funds to maximize the ecological return on investment, within the bounds of what is socially and politically feasible.  Additionally, RIOS quantifies returns for some of the most desired water benefits including erosion control, water purification, and flood mitigation.  Our goal for RIOS is to provide a standardized approach to water fund design and investment prioritization in contexts throughout the world.</p>

<p>RIOS's first public release is scheduled for Spring of 2013 but it is available on our website now as a <a href="../rios_download.html">prototype in development</a>.</p>

<h2>Understanding and Mapping Environmental Services</h2>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="../images/nta01.jpg" alt="© TNC-Northern Tropical Andes (Bridget Besaw and Diego Ochoa)" height="167" width="250" /></div>
<p>
Making environmental services information useful and tractable in
policy-making and identifying priority areas for conservation requires
an understanding of which services are important, where service flows
originate, and where people use them. The national planning agencies
and environmental authorities in the region have been very interested
in a conservation approach that integrates benefits for people and
their well-being with biodiversity conservation. </p>
<p>Using <a href="../InVEST.html">InVEST</a>,
TNC staff in NASCA have been able to provide a visual depiction of the
spatial distribution and overlap of a variety of services to the
environmental ministries. TNC offices in Ecuador and Colombia are
publishing national maps of several environmental service flows. With these
types of national-level environmental services maps, TNC is better equiped
to inform government about a variety of policies such as siting and
licensing for infrastructure projects by national agencies, avoiding,
mitigating, and offsetting environmental impacts, and where and how to
invest limited conservation funds.</p>
<br />
<h2>Climate Adaptation in Colombia: designing an adaptive compensation and rewards program for environmental services</h2>
</br>
<p>In the Putumayo region of Colombia, cloud and rainforests are threatened by the 
advance of large-scale infrastructure projects and the agricultural frontier, which
 are likely to be exacerbated by the impacts of climate change. WWF scientists and 
<a href="http://www.natura.org.co">Fundaci&oacuten Natura</a> are studying the impacts 
of these threats on the supply of environmental services in the region. We are identifying 
new strategies to maintain nature's benefits over the long term, including converting 
traditional livestock production to silvopastoral systems and designing financial 
incentives for conservation. We are working with regional environmental planning 
agencies to test the benefits of these strategies to maintain or enhance environmental service supply</p>

<h2>Environmental Service Maps Informing Policy Decisions</h2>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="../images/nta_14.jpg" alt="© TNC - Oil and gas industry generates impacts on biodiversity (Diego Ochoa)" height="154" width="250" /> </div>
<p>
In Colombia, TNC and partners (including the <a href="http://www.humboldt.org.co/">Humboldt Institute</a>,
<a href="http://www.conservation.org/">Conservation
International</a>, and <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org">WWF</a>)
have a 3-year agreement with the <a href="http://www.minambiente.gov.co">Ministry of the
Environment</a> to provide them with a tool to help the National
Government make decisions about where to site infrastructure projects
(gas, coal, mining, roads, transportation, harbors, etc). The primary
goal: help inform the process of how to avoid, minimize, and compensate
biodiversity impacts from concessions projects. The biodiversity data
layers are based on ecoregional maps developed by TNC but a more
fine-scale version of these maps using modified, more spatially
explicit data layers are being developed for regional-scale planning.
The goal is to overlay environmental service maps from InVEST with the
biodiversity maps so government can have information on biodiversity
and services. </p>
<p>In Ecuador, a similar process is underway to inform the main
national planning agency: Secretaria Nacional de Planificacion y
Desarrollo (<a href="http://www.planificacion.gob.ec//">SENPLADES</a>).
Here software has been developed with models that provide dynamic
biodiversity maps. The data layers will allow the software to calculate
the effect of theoretical infrastructure projects on biodiversity.
Users draw a polygon, line, or point as a proxy for an infrastructure
project. The software generates biodiversity impact maps based on these
inputs. InVEST maps provide an environmental services layer giving a
snapshot of the effects of the projects on service flows. </p>

<p>&#8220;Nine watersheds tumble into Cauca Valley, a region in the
southwest of Colombia sandwiched between two of the Colombia Andean
mountain chains. For centuries, its richness has attracted humans, who
exploited the valley's resources first for agriculture and
stockbreeding, and later for hydroelectric power generation. Today,
sugar cane production dominates the valley's industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;'There are many stresses from water use. The sugar cane
sector is thirsty, but the people who live there also need it for daily
activities and for drinking water,' says Alejandro Calvache, a water
fund specialist at The Nature Conservancy, based in Cartagena,
Columbia. TNC, in collaboration with the sugar cane growers'
association, the regional environmental authority and several
grassroots organizations, is building a water fund that will oversee a
massive program of reforestation, water protection, soil improvements,
education and training. By investing in the region's ecosystem
services, the project, which is called 'Agua Por La Vida y la
Sostenibilidad' &#8212; meaning 'Water for Life and sustainability' &#8212; aims to
lessen climate change impacts and threats to biodiversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Water funds exist globally to conserve watersheds, but this
is one of the first to include climate change modelling to help direct
investments. The International Center for Tropical Agriculture, a
research institute in Columbia, is modelling scenarios to determine the
effects of climate change on local water resources. These scenarios are
then fed into a computer-based decision-making tool called InVEST,
which has been developed by the Natural Capital Project, a partnership
between TNC, Stanford University and the World Wildlife Fund. InVEST
identifies the areas where climate change is unlikely to threaten
activities the water fund has been invested in &#8212; such as promoting the
reforestation of a hillside or teaching eco-friendly cattle-ranching
practices &#8212; and their returns. 'Traditionally, conservation has pulled
on people's heart-strings,' says Heather Tallis, lead scientist at
Natural Capital. 'We try to appeal to people's lifeblood, like drinking
water.'&#8221;</p>
