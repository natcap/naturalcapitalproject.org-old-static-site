<p>Thanks to a generous grant from The Rockefeller Foundation, The Natural Capital Project and its partners have spearheaded projects in China and Indonesia to integrate information about ecosystem services into infrastructure decisions. NatCap is developing methods and tools to visualize and quantify linkages between infrastructure development, ecosystem services and resulting human well-being. Through these initiatives, we are helping identify standard approaches for integrating social equity and poverty alleviation into infrastructure investment decisions. </p>

<h2>Understanding stakeholders' needs </h2>
<p>In January 2013, a workshop entitled Linking Ecosystem Change to Human Well-being was hosted by the Natural Capital Project and The Rockefeller Foundation in New York. Participants included representatives from the InterAmerican Development Bank, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, The World Bank, USAID, and Citigroup, as well as key academic and policy experts from China. The workshop explored the linkages between changing natural capital, impacts on human well-being and infrastructure design and investment.  </p>

<h2>Applications</h2>
<p><b>Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia </b></p>

<p>Indonesia has completed a national-level spatial plan for future infrastructure investment, including the development of ports and highways to support expanding industries (e.g. palm oil). The Natural Capital Project and partners at WWF-US and WWF-Indonesia are supporting province and district-level spatial planning in Jambi Province by estimating how changes in land use and land cover could impact ecosystem services and local well-being. This analysis included economic evaluation of fuel wood, water for irrigation, and carbon storage. 
In collaboration with partners at Duke University, we also calculated potential impacts of infrastructure-related changes on agricultural profitability, cost of water collection for domestic use, and health (incidence of diarrhea). </p>
<br />
<p><b>Miyun  Watershed, Hebei Province/Beijing, China </b></p>
<p>The Natural Capital Project worked with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Beijing Water Institute in the Miyun watershed to assess how "soft infrastructure" – policies that have land use implications – can impact ecosystem services and local livelihoods. The study measured the overall costs and benefits of the Paddy Land-to-Dry Land (PLDL) land use conversion program, resulting impacts on water quality and quantity, and shifts in livelihoods portfolios (e.g. household production and consumption and agricultural income). For more details about this program and methods for assessing livelihood changes, see <a href="#Publications">Zheng et al. 2013</a>. </p>
<br />
<p><b>Ankang Municipality, China </b></p>
<p>NatCap collaborated with Xi'an Jiaotong University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Ankang Municipality, China. We estimated the impacts of a voluntary ecological relocation project initiated by the Shaanxi provincial government in 2011, designed to move 2.4 million people. The program moves residents from steep, disaster-prone mountains to safer areas where the government is better able to provide basic infrastructure. This effort was the largest resettlement for ecological conservation, disaster reduction and poverty alleviation in modern China, with planned public investment of over 110 billion yuan (US $17.9 billion) in infrastructure and individual payments. </p><p>
InVEST was used to project future ES provision under the relocation scheme, first by quantifying its impacts on ecosystem services, and then by identifying the spatial distribution of ES changes for different scenarios. The study also included a large-scale household survey to assess changes in assets, livelihood opportunities, and overall well-being of local residents. These efforts will enable decision-makers to better understand the overall costs and benefits for both ecosystem services and human well-being.

<h2>Linking scientists and practitioners to inform decision-making </h2>
<p>A policy workshop entitled Incorporating Nature's Value into Infrastructure Decisions will be hosted by The Natural Capital Project and The Rockefeller Foundation at World Wildlife Fund on October 7th and 8th, 2013. Participants will include representatives from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, InterAmerican Development Bank, and USAID as well as experts on ecosystem services. Goals include identifying key opportunities and needs for incorporating nature's value into infrastructure investment, including tool development, resources and expertise, and standardized approaches. </p>
 </p>

<a name="Tools" id="Tools"></a>
<h2>Developing new tools and resources </h2>
<p> Scientists at the Natural Capital Project are developing new tools to quantify the value of nature for local communities. For example, NatCap has developed an Indonesia-specific prototype for a model measuring the ecosystem service of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) that is going through internal testing. 
NatCap is also testing a village impact modeler (VIMerator) for local level and distribution impact mapping; it is currently under internal review and development.
