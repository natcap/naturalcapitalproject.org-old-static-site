<h2>Natural Capital & Roads: Managing dependencies and impacts on ecosystem services for sustainable road investments</h2>
<p style="margin:10px"><a href="../pubs/Natural_Capital_and_Roads.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="../images/Natural_Capital_and_Roads_Report.jpg" width="145" height="187"/></a></p>
<p>This document illustrates how incorporating ecosystem services into road project design and development can lead to more sustainable, cost-effective roads while maintaining or enhancing the additional benefits nature provides to the region's citizens, from clean water and air, to food and timber.</p>

<h1>Infrastructure & Development</h1>
<p>The Natural Capital Project (NatCap) and its partners are collaborating in China and Indonesia to integrate information about ecosystem services into infrastructure decisions. Supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, NatCap is developing analytical methods and software tools to quantify and visualize linkages between infrastructure development, ecosystem services and human well-being. These initiatives support scientists in designing standard approaches for integrating social equity and poverty alleviation into infrastructure investment decisions. </p>

<h2>Applications</h2>
<p><b>Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia </b></p>
<p>Indonesia has completed a national-level spatial plan for future infrastructure investment, including the development of ports and highways to support expanding industries (e.g. palm oil). NatCap and partners at WWF-US and WWF-Indonesia are supporting province and district-level spatial planning in Jambi Province by estimating how changes in land use and land cover could impact ecosystem services and local well-being. This analysis included economic evaluation of fuel wood, water for irrigation, and carbon storage. 
In collaboration with partners at Duke University, we also calculated potential impacts of infrastructure-related changes on agricultural profitability, cost of water collection for domestic use, and human health indicators. </p>
<br />
<p><b>Miyun  Watershed, Hebei Province/Beijing, China </b></p>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="../images/infrastructure_china_pic.jpg" alt="China Miyun reservoir" width="300" height="200"/></div>
<p>The Natural Capital Project worked with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Beijing Water Institute in the Miyun watershed to assess how "soft infrastructure" – policies that have land use implications – can impact ecosystem services and local livelihoods. The study measured the overall costs and benefits of the Paddy Land-to-Dry Land (PLDL) land use conversion program, resulting impacts on water quality and quantity, and shifts in livelihoods portfolios (e.g. household production and consumption and agricultural income). For more details about this program and methods for assessing livelihood changes, see <a href="#Publications">Zheng et al. 2013</a>. </p>
<br />
<p><b>Ankang Municipality, China </b></p>
<p>NatCap collaborated with Xi'an Jiaotong University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Ankang Municipality, China. Scientists estimated the impacts of a voluntary ecological relocation project initiated by the Shaanxi provincial government in 2011, designed to move 2.4 million people. The program moves residents from steep, disaster-prone mountains to safer areas where the government is better able to provide basic infrastructure. This effort was the largest resettlement for ecological conservation, disaster reduction and poverty alleviation in modern China, with planned public investment of over 110 billion yuan (US $17.9 billion) in infrastructure and individual payments. </p><p>
InVEST was used to project future ES provision under the relocation scheme, first by quantifying its impacts on ecosystem services, and then by identifying the spatial distribution of ES changes for different scenarios. The study also included a large-scale household survey to assess changes in assets, livelihood opportunities, and overall well-being of local residents. These efforts will enable decision makers to better understand the overall costs and benefits for both ecosystem services and human well-being.

<h2>Ecosystem Services in Transportation Lending Decisions</h2>
	      <div class="photo_right"> <a href="http://www.iadb.org/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.microsoft.com/publicsector/PublishingImages/265x150/IDB.png" alt="IDB logo" width="200"  
          /></a> </div>
          <p>The Natural Capital project is working with the Inter-American Development Bank's <a href="http://www.iadb.org/en/topics/environment/biodiversity-platform/biodiversity-platform/idb-biodiversity-ecosystem-services-latin-america,7721.html">Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Program</a> and <a href="http://www.iadb.org/en/topics/transportation/transportation,1236.html">Transport Division</a> to integrate ecosystem service information into transport lending decisions. The  <a href="http://www.iadb.org/en/inter-american-development-bank,2837.html">Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)</a> is the leading source of development financing for Latin America and the Caribbean.  NatCap is working closely with IDB to develop approaches and tools tailored to the needs of the bank's transport specialists. Our work focuses on assessing transport project impacts and dependence on ecosystem services – erosion control services can reduce road maintenance costs, for example – and incorporating these benefits into project planning to enhance the sustainability of the bank's transport investments.</p>

<a name="Linking" id="Linking"></a>
<h2>Linking scientists and practitioners to inform decision-making </h2>
<p>NatCap and The Rockefeller Foundation hosted several workshops with representatives from the Inter-American Development Bank, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, The World Bank, USAID, Citigroup, and key academic and policy experts. Together these groups are identifying the need and opportunities for using a standard approach to infrastructure design that incorporates ecosystem services. Ongoing discussions are focused on tool development, existing resources and expertise, and the fundamental linkages between changing natural capital and impacts to human well-being.</p>
 </p>
<br/><br />
<a name="Tools" id="Tools"></a>
<h2>Developing new tools and resources </h2>
<p> NatCap scientists are developing new tools to quantify the value of nature for local communities. For example, NatCap has developed an Indonesia-specific prototype for a model measuring the ecosystem service of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) that is undergoing internal testing. 
NatCap is also testing a village impact modeler (VIMerator) for local level and distribution impact mapping; it is currently under internal review and development.
