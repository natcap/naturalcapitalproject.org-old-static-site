<br /><h1>Servicesheds</h1>
<p>A <strong>serviceshed</strong> describes the area providing an ecosystem service to specific users of that service, or the <i>service beneficiaries</i>. Each ecosystem service, like flood protection, erosion control, clean drinking water, and climate regulation, can be viewed in relation to the area of landscape or ocean from which it originates.</p>
      <p>Three factors influence the boundaries of servicesheds:
<ul>
	  <li><b>Supply:</b> Where ecological processes produce a specific service. There may be demand for a service like protection from coastal storm surge, but if there are no natural habitats to buffer waves in the coastal zone, then there is no supply of that service.</li>
      <br />
	  <li><strong>Physical Access:</strong> A watershed may be providing clean water, but if people lack access to wells, pipes, paths to the river or other means of physically taking water, then that service of clean water is not being provided to people.</li>
      <br />
	  <li><strong>Institutional Access:</strong> Access rights to a service. In some parts of the world, these come in the form of legal rights like use zones, water use rights, fishing permits and so on. In other parts of the world, informal rules determine access, like in Cambodia, Kenya and many other countries where communities restrict access to spirit forests, or seasonal no-take zones for fisheries.</li>
<br />

<p><h3>The serviceshed approach presents a method to analyze mitigation potential, from the perspective of people</h3></p>
<p>The serviceshed for carbon sequestration is the entire planet because the atmosphere is well mixed. Carbon sequestration anywhere by any plants benefits all people</p>
  <p> For water-related services (e.g., drinking water supply, hydropower supply, water purification, flood mitigation, erosion control), the serviceshed is the land area upstream of the place where people legally access water. In the water services map, we see the lower part of the map is not in a serviceshed because there is no city downstream. The middle part of the map is in one serviceshed because it has one city downstream (black dot), and the upper part is in two servicesheds, with two cities downstream.</p>

      <p>Crop pollination benefits are provided very locally. The distance that wild crop pollinators can fly defines the serviceshed around a field with pollinator-depending crops. Some servicesheds can be more complex to define, like those shown in the servicehsed map for clean water for fish. In this map, we see five lakes that have recreational fish populations near a city. Each of the lakes' watersheds can act as a filter that keeps the water clean and supports healthy fish populations, and so provides the 'supply'. People are willing to drive as far as the white boundary to go fishing (demand), but lake 4 is not in the serviceshed  because it does not have road access (physical access). Lake 5 is too far away and has no road (again, no physical access), and lake 3 is protected and closed to fishing (institutional or legal access). This leaves lakes 1 and 2 within the demand area for the city, with both physical and institutional access. So the serviceshed for this one ecosystem service is the watershed areas of those two lakes.</p>
