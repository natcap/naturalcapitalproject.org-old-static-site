 <h2>Peru Report</h2>
<p style="margin:10px"><a href="../pubs/Pucallpa_Final_Report_2013.pdf" target="_blank"><img src= "../images/Pullcallpa_report_pic.jpg" width="145" height="187"/></a></p>
<p> In 2013 NatCap, TNC, and USAID released a report analyzing the impacts of proposed road construction in Peru that accounts for losses of natural capital. The report quantifies what amount of ecosystem services will be lost, identifies which commnunities will be most affected, and evaluates the potential to mitigate losses through restoration.</p>

<h1>Permitting & Mitigation</h1>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="http://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/colombiaopenpit.JPG" alt="Columbian coal mine" width="250" /> </div>
<p>Nearly 200 countries require the completion of an environmental impact assessment for development projects, and a third of those also require mitigation to offset environmental degradation.</p>
<p>NatCap is developing a framework for mitigation programs that includes ecosystem services. Our approach enables policy makers to more comprehensively evaluate the impact of new infrastructure on nature and people.</p>
<p>Incorporating ecosystem services in impact assessment and mitigation processes is required by a growing number of lending institutions, including the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank. NatCap scientists are engaging leaders at these institutions to integrate metrics of ecosystem service assessment into global lending decisions. On the ground, NatCap employs its ecosystem service modeling tools to inform development policy and mitigation schemes in several applications throughout Latin America.

<h2>Linking Impact to Ecosystems and Human Well-Being</h2>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/110/277626621_b324f4d8c8_m.jpg" alt="Amazonian People" width="250" /></div>
<p>NatCap's approach to impact assessment links ecosystem benefits and losses to people. Our work provides a foundation for mitigation policy that places a premium on human well-being as it depends on security of ecosystem services.</p>
<p>To measure environmental impact, NatCap scientists use spatially-explicit representations of service losses and analyze them in relation to population densities and proximity to a <a href="servicesheds.html">serviceshed</a>, the geographic area producing a specific service for human beneficiaries. This analytical approach can identify communities that benefit most significantly from restoration efforts, and those for which full mitigation of impacts is less likely. Accounting for the distribution of ecosystem service losses among populations can also avoid social inequities that arise when ecosystem services (e.g., clean drinking water, recreational opportunities) are restored to some people but not others.</p>
<br />
<a name="Applications" id="Applications"></a>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>Incoporating ecosystem services into environmental impact assessments and mitigation schemes enables policy makers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan development projects to <b>minimize ecosystem service losses</b> and <b>reduce risk</b> of unintended environmental consequences</li><br />
<li><b>Quantify impacts of development</b> and mitigation activities on people, including consequences for social equity</li><br />
<li>Determine the potential to efficiently <b>offset ecosystem service losses or reach no net loss</b> of ecosystem services with mitigation</li><br />
</ul>

<h2>Coal Mining Permits in Colombia</h2>
<p>Working with the Colombian Ministry of Environment and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), NatCap evaluated the impacts of new and proposed coal mine permits on drinking water quality regulation services in the Cesar Department. Analyses suggested where mitigation was likely to offset the impacts of mine expansion, and for which mines full mitigation is unlikely.</p>
<p> This initial analysis is being adapted into a general decision-support tool for the Ministry of the Environment for evaluating biodiversity and ecosystem service impacts on people using a standard approach.</p>

<h2>Road Construction through the Peruvian Amazon</h2>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="../images/Pucallpa_Rd_map.png" alt="Peruvian Amazon" width="300" height="187" /></div>
<p> In Peru, NatCap worked with TNC to determine how construction of the Pucallpa-Cruzeiro do Sul road to Brazil could impact ecosystem services for local communities.</p>
<p>While the road would increase local access to international markets and improve livelihood opportunities for many, it will also likely increase deforestation and other environmental impacts in a biologically sensitive region of the Amazon. </p>
<p> Scientists applied InVEST and new models to determine the most effective locations for mitigation, reforestation and protection efforts. Although mitigation activities could potentially offset much of the ecosystem service losses associated with road construction, results reveal that it is not possible to offset the impacts to all people, and that indigenous communities are likely to bear a disproportionate burden of development.</p>
<p>Our approach is now being used to compare the impacts and mitigation potential of possible power transmission line routes in Peru.

<h2>Preliminary Results</h2>
<br />
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Developed a new approach to mitigation</b> that identifies ecosystem service 'winners' and 'losers.' Our framework of <a href="servicesheds.html">servicesheds </a>tracks where ecosystem services are provided as well as their flow to different populations (e.g., indigenous and urban communities) and how those services might change under various mitigation options. </li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Partnership with the Colombian Ministry of the Environment</b> in the creation of a decision support tool to inform permitting and mitigation schemes</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Directed InVEST training in Peru</b> with over 70 specialists from the region including representatives from regional governments, NGOs and universities. Participants shared knowledge and experience from applying the tool to real-world decisions in their countries.</li>
