<p>NatCap was formed in 2006 with the goal of seeing ecosystem service information transform decisions and improve the wellbeing of both people and nature. There have been rapid advances in ecosystem service science and in putting that science in the hands of many, but applying ecosystem service information to real-world decision-making is far from commonplace.  NatCap is working to change that.</p>
 
<p>Perhaps the most signficant lessons we have learned in our 20+ engagements in decisions around the world are the importance of building trust with decision makers, the need to co-produce results with partners who will use them, and the necessity of training locals to take ownership of the science as the science-policy processes continue. The central lessons we learned in incorporating biodiversity and ecosystem service (BES) science into real-world decision making include:</p>
 <br />
<a name="Lessons" id="Lessons"></a>
<p><b>Include biodiversity and ecosystem service information as part of an iterative science-policy process</b></p>
<p>An interactive science-policy process involving scientists, local experts, stakeholders, and decision makers to produce results enhances the credibility, salience, and legitimacy of biodiversity and ecosystem service information used in real-world decisions that impact the environment and human wellbeing. </p>
 
<p><b>Keep it simple (for now)</b></p>
<p>Decision makers typically ask for simple, easy-to-use models and understandable decision support tools that can be readily incorporated in the science-policy process.  Even the simplest models we originally conceived did not go far enough in being accessible and understandable to our partners.</p>
 
<p><b>Empower local experts with the tools and knowledge to run the process</b></p> 
<p>Generating assessments with more participation and leadership by local governments and universities, particularly early on in the analysis, can create more buy-in and ownership of the results so that policy change is more likely. Local scientists ultimately are best equipped to make adjustments and improvements and to carry the work forward, often in more interesting and promising directions than outsiders.  </p>
 
<p><b>It's not (always) about the money </b></p>
<p>Ecosystem services can be valued in many currencies—only some of the monetary.  Often what decision makers want is to understand how alternative decisions might affect where ecosystem service benefits are supplied and to whom they are delivered. In some cases, this involves monetary valuation; but in many cases, stakeholders have expressly asked that we not attach monetary values to key benefits, particularly ones they consider 'priceless,' such as existence values of endangered species or sacred places.</p>
 
<p><b>Relate ecosystem services to human wellbeing</b></p>
<p>In nearly all of our applications, partners request that we trace the consequences of ecosystem service change through to human wellbeing outcomes, particularly as it relates to livelihoods, poverty alleviation and human health. This is not easy, but it is critical.  More work in this area—by NatCap and others--is sorely needed to help guide policy and management interventions that address livelihoods and human health and wellbeing.</p>
 
<p><b>Clearly and honestly report the degree of uncertainty</b></p>
<p>Communicating uncertainty in results in ways that are useful and transparent remains challenging. The application of ecosystem service models requires many assumptions, and outputs typically have considerable variation associated with them. We have learned to be as clear as possible about this uncertainty, and to openly discuss the usefulness and limitations of ecosystem service models and the implications of using them to inform decisions. </p>
<br />
<p>In our work to-date, we have already seen that significant strides can be made in informing decisions using an ecosystem services approach and simple, quantitative spatial tools. We see great potential for more widely incorporating ecosystem service information into a host of decision contexts, from spatial planning to permitting impact assessment and to payment for ecosystem service (PES) schemes. Decisions around climate adaptation planning and corporate risk management also offer exciting new opportunities to influence investments and development planning across the globe. Thanks to influential leaders in public and private institutions, the demand for ecosystem service science to inform policy processes continues to grow.</p>

<p><small>Pathways for and levels of impact of BES information on decisions. Each of the four columns represents a different 'pathway' that could constitute a level of success in informing decisions. Deeper impact is achieved as the process evolves from top to bottom down each pathway, and left to right between the four pathways. Pathway 1 represents the creation of BES outputs and research results that are published and disseminated. Pathway 2 represents impacts of BES information on the attitudes, beliefs, awareness and understanding of stakeholders and decision-makers. Pathway 3 represents the influence of BES information on specific actions and the behavior of decision-makers, which may constitute commitments, procedural change, or a specific decision about funding, continuing, amending, terminating or expanding a project, program or policy. Pathway 4 represents specific outcomes in terms of developing new policy or finance mechanisms, and making measurable improvements in ecosystem service provision, biodiversity and human wellbeing.</small></p>
