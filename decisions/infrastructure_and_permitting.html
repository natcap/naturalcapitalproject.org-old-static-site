<h1>Infrastructure Planning, Impact Assesment & Mitigation</h1>
<p>An estimated $57 trillion in infrastructure investment is needed by 2030 just to keep up with
global growth, representing a 60% increase in spending beyond recent rates, according to a 2013 estimate by McKinsey & Company. Infrastructure development provides critical economic benefits by improving access to markets, creating new jobs, and improving transportation and communication. However, these benefits often also come with environmental costs, including pollution of water and air, lost access to outdoor recreation, and threats to biodiversity. When these ecosystem services are overlooked, infrastructure investments can undermine development goals by degrading or eliminating the benefits from nature on which people depend. The Natural Capital Project is working to integrate ecosystem services information into infrastructure decisions in order to minimize infrastructure's negative impacts on nature and people, ensure the social equity of infrastructure policy, and enhance the sustainability of infrastructure investments.</p><br/>
<p>Our work in this area focuses on several decision contexts including:</p>

<h2>Accounting for ecosystem services in transportation investments</h2>
	      <div class="photo_right"> <a href="http://www.iadb.org/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.microsoft.com/publicsector/PublishingImages/265x150/IDB.png" alt="IDB logo" width="200"  
          /></a> </div>
          <p>The Natural Capital project is working with the Inter-American Development Bank's <a href="http://www.iadb.org/en/topics/environment/biodiversity-platform/biodiversity-platform/idb-biodiversity-ecosystem-services-latin-america,7721.html">Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Program</a> and <a href="http://www.iadb.org/en/topics/transportation/transportation,1236.html">Transport Division</a> to integrate ecosystem service information into transport lending decisions. The  <a href="http://www.iadb.org/en/inter-american-development-bank,2837.html">Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)</a> is the leading source of development financing for Latin America and the Caribbean.  NatCap is working closely with IDB to develop approaches and tools tailored to the needs of the bank's transport specialists. Our work focuses on assessing transport project impacts and dependence on ecosystem services – erosion control services can reduce road maintenance costs, for example – and incorporating these benefits into project planning to enhance the sustainability of the bank's transport investments. <a href="http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/decisions/infrastructure.html" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.</p>

<h2>Integrating social equity and poverty alleviation into infrastructure investment decisions</h2>
<p>NatCap is developing analytical methods and software tools to quantify and visualize linkages between infrastructure development, ecosystem services and human well-being. These initiatives support scientists in designing standard approaches for integrating social equity and poverty alleviation into infrastructure 
investment decisions. <a href="http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/decisions/infrastructure.html" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.</p>

<h2>Incorporating ecosystem services into environmental impact assessments and mitigation decisions</h2>
<p>Nearly 200 countries require the completion of an environmental impact assessment for development projects, and a third of those also require mitigation to offset environmental degradation. A growing number of lending institutions require clients to incorporate ecosystem services into environmental impact 
assessments and mitigation plans. Working with partners at The Nature Conservancy, NatCap is developing a framework and tools that enable decision makers to integrate ecosystem services into the impact assessment and mitigation process and more comprehensively evaluate the impact of new infrastructure on nature and people. <a href="http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/decisions/permitting.html" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.
