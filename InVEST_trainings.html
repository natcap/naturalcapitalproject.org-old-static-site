 <b>March 13th - 15th, 2013</b><br />

 <p>The Natural Capital Project will be holding our 2nd Annual Meeting & InVEST Training at Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA from March 13th-15th, 2013. The meeting will provide an opportunity for InVEST users and others interested in ecosystem services mapping and valuation, to learn more about the science and practice of using an ecosystem services approach and tools in real decisions.  Attendees can get hands-on experience with NatCap tools, and network and share stories about their work. The training will include how to run and use all of the models in the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) software suite, as well as presentations by users on how our tools and approaches are being used in decision contexts around the world. Last year, over 100 people participated in our inaugural annual meeting and InVEST training, and this year we anticipate an even greater turnout. There is a small fee to attend the training, with discounts available to people working in one of our partner institutions, and scholarships available for those in need. </p>

<a name="Vancouver" class="anchor"></a><h2>Natural Capital Project InVEST Training</h2>
 <b>February 4-5, 2013</b><br />
 <b>Vancouver, BC, Canada</b><br />
 <b>Cost: $100/day</b><br />
 <a href="http://events.constantcontact.com/register/event?llr=gszjijjab&oeidk=a07e6y6c5dpc253d87e">More information and registration</a>
 <p>The Natural Capital Project is holding a <a href="http://events.constantcontact.com/register/event?llr=gszjijjab&oeidk=a07e6y6c5dpc253d87e">training in Vancouver, BC, February 4-5, 2013</a>.  This two-day course will teach participants how to use the InVEST software suite and ways to apply approaches and tools for ecosystem service valuation in decision-making.</p>
 <p>The first day of the training provides an introduction to ecosystem service modeling and valuation, and using InVEST for spatial planning. This will include an overview of the diverse decision-making contexts in which InVEST has been applied, including work on marine spatial planning on the west coast of Vancouver Island.  Participants will also explore trade-offs among benefits through interactive mapping exercises.  The second day of the workshop is aimed at more technical users who want hands-on training using InVEST models.  We will focus on data preparation, implementing InVEST in GIS, and interpretation of model results.  The goal of this training is for attendees to walk away with the knowledge and confidence to apply the tools and approach in their own work.</p>
 <p><a href="http://events.constantcontact.com/register/event?llr=gszjijjab&oeidk=a07e6y6c5dpc253d87e">Registration is open until January 31st.</a></p>
