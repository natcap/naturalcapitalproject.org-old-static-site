  <p>Rebecca Goldman Benner is the Director of Science for TNC's North Carolina chapter. Rebecca received her PhD from the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources (E-IPER) program at Stanford in 2008. Her PhD work analyzed the benefits and drawbacks of an ecosystem services approach to conservation. After Stanford, Rebecca joined The Nature Conservancy, where she worked on the design of outcome-based measures for payment for watershed service projects, called water funds, throughout Latin America. She studied the process of developing and implementing a payment for ecosystem services (PES) program, including how to ensure the programs met their goals. Rebecca joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 2010 as a Senior Associate focusing on environment projects in Brazil, Colombia, Panama, and Jamaica. In June 2012 she assisted in the design and launch of the IDB's biodiversity platform.</p>
