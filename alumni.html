  <p>Matt Marsik was a post-doc research hydrologist funded under a NSF-NOAA CAMEO grant to build InVEST water yield and nutrient models to evaluate tradeoffs between terrestrial and marine management strategies in Puget Sound, Chesapeake Bay, and Galveston Bay. Marsik is a physical geographer specializing in surface hydrology modeling, climate variability, land cover change, GIS and remote sensing. Relevant experience includes land cover modeling of the central Puget Sound; land cover analysis in the southwestern Amazon; hydrologic modeling and climate analysis in Costa Rica; and spatial and temporal scaling of Landsat imagery in north-central Florida. Marsik received his PhD and MSc in Geography and a BSc in Geological Sciences, from the University of Florida.</p>

  <div class="photo_right"> <img src="images/bios/jim_regetz.jpg" alt="Jim Regetz" height="140" /> </div>
  <p> Jim Regetz was working with the Natural Capital Project team to develop a consistent vision for building and implementing InVEST models. At NCEAS, he consults with a broad array of scientists facing quantitative and computational challenges. His research activities all share a common thread of data analysis, modeling, and information management, with past projects including topics such as science planning for endangered species, salmon population dynamics, and crop pollination services. Regetz received a Masters degree in Environmental Science and Management from the University of California at Santa Barbara, and his Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University.</p>

  <div class="photo_right"><img src="images/bios/Sanjayan.gif" alt="M.A. Sanjayan" height="140" /></div>
  <p> M.A. Sanjayan was spearheading the Natural Capital Project's efforts to use environmental services approaches to improve the lives of the poor. Collaborating with scientists and conservationists, he is specifically attempting to improve understanding of African eco-regions and of threats such as climate change and private land development to successful conservation. Born in Sri Lanka, Sanjayan grew up in Africa and completed his PhD at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  After a stint at the World Bank, he joined TNC in 1999, first as the Director of Science for the California Program, and later as one of TNC's  three Lead Scientists.  He has a faculty appointment at University of Montana, where he occasionally teaches graduate seminar classes. </p>

  </p>
  <div class="photo_right"><img src="images/bios/sharma.jpg" alt="Manu Sharma" height="140" /></div>
  <p>Manu Sharma tested and developed water models for the Natural Capital Project. Before coming to NatCap, he had four years of hydrologic modeling experience with a focus on climate change impacts on the hydrologic condition of watersheds. He previously worked in consulting as Water Resources Engineer and Hydrogeologist. He earned a Masters degree in Civil Engineering with a specialization in Water Resources Engineering from McMaster University in Canada. Manu now works as a hydrologist for the Government of New Zealand.</p>
