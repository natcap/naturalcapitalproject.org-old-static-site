Previously, Charlie managed all seabird research and restoration activities at a coastal Maine field station for the National Audubon Society's Project Puffin. Charlie recently completed an Honors Thesis on prey pheromone preferences of the predacious checkered beetle and its role in population fluctuations of a major timber pest, the southern pine beetle.

  <p>Kremen's primary interest is to use biological, social, and economic data to develop conservation plans that benefit both the environment and people, and her work has included a wide array of topics, from the economics and ecology of environmental services, to reserve design and ecological monitoring. She was recently awarded a MacArthur Fellowship for her contributions to ecology, agriculture, and biodiversity. Her work reaches from theory to practice and includes hands-on conservation action, including design and establishment of one of  Madagascar's largest national parks. Her current research focuses on restoring pollination services within farming landscapes, using both predictive modeling and field studies. She was a member of the recent National Academy of Sciences study on the status of pollinators in North America. In Madagascar, she works to establish a national web-based conservation-planning tool by accumulating data on species occurrences, developing predictive models of species distributions, conducting conservation analyses, and making data and analyses accessible via the Internet.</p>
