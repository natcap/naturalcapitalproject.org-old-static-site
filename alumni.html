  <div class="photo_right"> <img src="images/bios/joey_bernhardt.jpg" alt="Joey Bernhardt" height="140" /> </div>
  <p>Joey Bernhardt joined the marine team of the Natural Capital Project in April, 2012. Since then, she has been working on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, where the Natural Capital Project has partnered with the West Coast Aquatic Management Board to help bring science capacity to the marine spatial planning process. She also works on the Habitat Risk Assessment model and the marine carbon model. She continues her collaboration with NatCap as a student at the University of British Columbia focusing on the effect of climate change on ecosystem services.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Marc Conte, Ph.D.</span><br />
  </p>Assistant Professor, Environmental Economics, Fordham University
  <div class="photo_right"> <img src="images/bios/marc_conte.jpg" alt="Marc Conte" height="140" width="87"/> </div>
  <p>Marc Conte is currently working as a professor of Environmental Economics at Fordham University. While with NatCap, he worked on developing and applying environmental service valuation models with the Natural Capital Project. He is particularly interested in the impact of policy mechanism choice on the magnitude and location of service provision across the landscape.  Conte received a Ph.D. from the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara as a fellow in the NSF-funded Economics and Environmental Science IGERT program. Marc Conte is currently an economics professor at Fordham University.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Charlie Governali</span><br />
  </p> Student, Dartmouth University <br />
  <div class="photo_right"> <img src="images/bios/Charlie.jpg" alt="Charlie Governali" height="200" /> </div>
  <p>Charlie Governali was working with Guy Ziv on the parameterization and testing of new model forms for InVEST's biodiversity tool. Prior to work at NatCap, Charlie conducted ecological research on shorebird biology in Alaska with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and on  warbler demography at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. Previously, Charlie managed all seabird research and restoration activities at a coastal Maine field station for the National Audubon Society's Project Puffin. Charlie recently completed an Honors Thesis on prey pheromone preferences of the predacious checkered beetle and its role in population fluctuations of a major timber pest, the southern pine beetle.  Charlie is currently finishing his last year of his undergraduate studies in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at Dartmouth College.</p>

   <p><a name="Marsik" class="anchor"></a></p>
   <p> <span class="name">Matthew Marsik, Ph.D.</span>
        <br /> Geospatial Scientist - TNC- Washington State<br />
    </p>
   <div class="photo_right"> <img src="images/bios/marsik.jpg" alt="Matthew Marsik" height="140" /> </div>
  <p>Matt Marsik was a post-doc research hydrologist funded under a NSF-NOAA CAMEO grant to build InVEST water yield and nutrient models to evaluate tradeoffs between terrestrial and marine management strategies in Puget Sound, Chesapeake Bay, and Galveston Bay. Marsik is a physical geographer specializing in surface hydrology modeling, climate variability, land cover change, GIS and remote sensing. He is currently working as a geospatial scientist for TNC's Washington State office. Relevant experience includes land cover modeling of the central Puget Sound; land cover analysis in the southwestern Amazon; hydrologic modeling and climate analysis in Costa Rica; and spatial and temporal scaling of Landsat imagery in north-central Florida. Marsik received his PhD and MSc in Geography and a BSc in Geological Sciences, from the University of Florida.</p>

  </p>
  <div class="photo_right"> <img src="images/bios/erik_nelson.jpg" alt="Erik Nelson" height="140" /> </div>
  <p> Nelson is working with the Natural Capital Project to develop a set of tools for mapping and modeling environmental service values across the landscape. Nelson is particularly interested in determining how sensitive valuation calculations are to choice of mapping scale, availability of data, and model parameter uncertainty. Nelson received his Ph.D. from the Department of Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota with a concentration in Environmental Economics and a minor in Conservation Biology. </p>

<p><a name="Sharma" class="anchor"></a> </p>
  <p><span class="name">Manu Sharma</span><br />
  </p> Hydrologist
  <div class="photo_right"><img src="images/bios/sharma.jpg" alt="Manu Sharma" height="140" /></div>
  <p>Manu Sharma is currently working as a hydrologist for the New Zealand government. While at NatCap, he tested and developed water models for the Natural Capital Project. Before coming to NatCap, he had four years of hydrologic modeling experience with a focus on climate change impacts on the hydrologic condition of watersheds. He previously worked in consulting as Water Resources Engineer and Hydrogeologist. He earned a Masters degree in Civil Engineering with a specialization in Water Resources Engineering from McMaster University in Canada. Manu now works as a hydrologist for the Government of New Zealand.</p>

  <p>Heather Tallis, one of the world's foremost analysts of the connections between nature and human well-being, is continuing her work with the Natural Capital Project as a Lead Scientist with The Nature Conservancy. She is the first woman to serve as lead scientist in the Conservancy's history. At TNC, Heather focuses on bringing science about people into the work of the Conservancy. Tallis holds an M.S. in chemical oceanography from the University of California, Santa Cruz, an M.S. in marine ecology from the University of Otago in New Zealand and a Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Washington. She is co-editor of the book, Natural Capital: The Theory and Practice of Mapping Ecosystem Services (Oxford, 2011) and has been widely published in scientific journals.</p>
