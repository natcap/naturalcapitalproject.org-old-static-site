  </p>Science Director - TNC North Carolina
  <div class="photo_right"> <img src="http://blog.nature.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/rgoldman.jpg" alt="Rebecca Goldman" /> </div>
  <p>Rebecca Benner, formerly Rebecca Goldman, worked at NatCap and graduated from Stanford University with a PhD in E-IPER in 2008. For her PhD at Stanford, she combined her science background with economics, policy analysis, and institutional studies to research an effective way to market conservation strategies on working landscapes both in the United States and abroad.  Her focus was on ecosystem services and her research analyzed benefits and drawbacks of taking an ecosystem services approach to conservation. After Stanford, Rebecca joined The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in 2008 where she primarily worked on the design of outcome-based measures for payment for watershed service projects, called water funds, proliferating throughout Latin America.  In this process, she studied the process of developing and implementing a payment for ecosystem services (PES) program including how to ensure the programs met their goals.  From TNC Rebecca joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 2010 as a Senior Associate focusing on environment projects in Brazil, Colombia, Panama, and Jamaica.  In addition, she worked on helping design the IDB's biodiversity platform which was launched in June 2012. Rebecca is now  Director of Science for TNC's North Carolina chapter.</p>
