Every 5 years, the government of Indonesia produces a national land use plan. And while the most recent plan was just recently completed, it will actually be implemented at the province and district levels over the next year.</p>
<br />
<h2>Local partners invited to map environmental services for land use plans on Sumatra</h2>
<br />
<p>
WWF-Indonesia has been invited to contribute to the land-use planning process in several provinces and districts on Sumatra (Aceh, Jambi, Lampung, Riau, West Sumatra) by modeling environmental services under current and alternative future land use scenarios. This has the potential to inform decisions relating to extractive industry projects – such as paper, pulp and palm oil, which can lead to deforestation, significant degradation of environmental services, and loss of biodiversity in Indonesia's conservation priority areas. Mapping and valuing environmental services can provide incentives to manage conservation priority areas sustainably and to restore degraded habitats.
</p>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/indo_03.jpg" width="230" alt="&copy; Kim Worm Sorensen - Fire in peat forest of Central Sumatra, Indonesia" /> </div>
<p>
The resulting maps and analyses will be used as government-sanctioned land-use planning tools, and may also be used for advocacy, outreach to the public and media, and to identify districts within these provinces that offer potential for Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs. 
</p>
<p>
Many areas that were zoned for conservation under the new national land use plan had previously been designated as concessions for timber, pulp, palm oil and other economic uses, and these concessions are often in effect for many years to come, regardless of any recent conservation designation, thus there is a strong need for incentives to prevent these concessions from being put into use, which is where PES could be relevant. Water and carbon are the key services, along with haze (from forest fire) reduction.

<h2>Historic commitment to conservation on Sumatra</h2>

<p>At the World Conservation Congress in Barcelona in October 2008, ten provincial governors and other Indonesian government representatives committed to protecting the remaining forests and critical ecosystems of Sumatra. To support this initiative, WWF and partners have already provided guidance to the governors (at their request) through a "Sumatra 2020 vision map" that advocates for ecosystem-based land use planning incorporating critical areas  for biodiversity and peatland conservation.</p>

<p><b>European Space Agency InVESTs in the Heart of Borneo, March 2011</b></p>
<p> As part of the Heart of Borneo Initiative's work supporting the three Borneo governments in their efforts to find out what the 22million ha of land in the HoB is worth,
WWF is using an innovative GIS based tool called Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Trade-offs (<a href="http://assets.panda.org/downloads/wwf_hob_newsletter_december_2010.pdf">InVEST</a>). Supported by the European Space Agency (ESA), which has recently granted US$70,000 towards data acquisition and GIS resources, InVEST provides maps showing the quantity and location of environmental services (such as forest or peat carbon, water yields and non-timber forest products) within the landscape. <a href="http://assets.panda.org/downloads/wwf_hob_newsletter_march_2011.pdf" target="_blank">European Space Agency InVESTs in the Heart of Borneo (Page 9)</a>

<p><b>Work expands to Borneo: The Economics of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services to guide Policy, Finance and Private Sector Decision-making in the Heart of Borneo Landscape 3-day Kick-off Workshop Held in Jakarta December 1-3, 2010</b></p>
<p>WWF-Indonesia hosted development partners (UKG, DFID, FAO, UNDP, UN-REDD) and government agencies (Indonesia's Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Public Works), international consulting firms PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Hatfield and Witteveen+Bos, representatives from University of Indonesia and staff from WWF US, Malaysia and Indonesia. The Heart of Borneo Initiative seeks to encourage the development of an economic environment whereby the forests of Borneo are worth more standing than cut down. The tropical rainforests in the Heart of Borneo are rich in natural capital which is of great value to all three Bornean countries (Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei). To be able to integrate the value of nature, all stakeholders (governments, business and communities) who play a role in the management of this landscape
need to better understand the economic value of biodiversity and environmental services, its potential for carbon emission reduction and the distribution of environmental services to users and beneficiaries. <a href="http://assets.panda.org/downloads/wwf_hob_newsletter_december_2010.pdf" target="_blank">The Heart of Borneo: what is it worth?

<p>
The objectives of the workshop were to provide training on the use of InVEST, and policy and finance aspects of environmental services, and also to develop a work plan for applying environmental services to land use planning in Indonesia. Building on the training and work plan, WWF Indonesia will provide input in planning activities commencing in the island's provinces and districts this year. GIS staff, land use planners, and policy makers from Riau, Jambi, and West Sumatra and the national Government ran the InVEST carbon and open access modules using available data for central Sumatra. <a href="http://assets.wwfid.panda.org/downloads/newsletter_wwf_id2ndedition_2009_1.pdf" target="_blank">Modeling Ecosystem Services: Workshop for Sumatra Land Use Planners and Policy Makers (Page 6)</a>
