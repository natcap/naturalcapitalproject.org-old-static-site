  <p> Ruckelshaus oversees all work of the Natural Capital Project partnership including strategy, coordination, fundraising, communications, and hiring. She is based in Seattle, WA, where she was a staff scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service for 13 years. Prior to that, she was an assistant professor of biological sciences at The Florida State University (1994-1997). The main focus of her recent work is on developing ecological models including estimates of the flow of ecosystem services under different management regimes in marine systems worldwide. Ruckelshaus serves on the board of The Nature Conservancy (and its Science Council), is a Trustee on The Nature Conservancy's Washington Board, and is a past chair of the Science Advisory Board of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). Ruckelshaus has also been chief scientist for the Puget Sound Partnership, a public-private institution charged with achieving recovery of the Puget Sound terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Ruckelshaus has a bachelor's degree in human biology from Stanford University, a master's degree in fisheries from the University of Washington, and a doctoral degree in botany, also from Washington. </p>

  <p> Arkema is working on Marine InVEST, a set of models for quantifying the services provided by coastal and marine ecosystems. Arkema's research interests include community ecology, biophysical-coupling in nearshore habitats, marine ecosystem-based management, and land-sea interactions. Arkema received her Ph.D. from the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology at the University of California, Santa Barbara and her B.A. in ecology with a minor in Latin American studies from Princeton University.</p>

Building on the success of the terrestrial InVEST tool, the marine team is building Marine InVEST, an ecosystem services scenario assessment tool for marine and coastal systems.  Beyond ecosystem services, Anne's primary research interests are in community ecology, rocky intertidal systems, and ecosystem-based management.  She received her PhD in zoology from Oregon State University, her MS in wildlife ecology from the University of Maine, and her BA in Environmental Studies and English from Yale University. </p>

  <div class="photo_right"><img src="images/bios/rosenthal.jpg" alt="Amy Rosenthal" height="140" /></div>
  <p> 
Rosenthal is working with the team and partner sites to create science-policy interface tools that integrate ecosystem services into decisions about land management and development. Previously, she helped the Amazon Conservation Association establish an ecosystem services program, designed major initiatives for conservation of the Western Amazon, and developed a series of tools and methodologies for avoided deforestation carbon projects. She has run an environmental management training program with the Federal University of Acre in Brazil, evaluated a leadership institute for First Nations students with the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford, represented book authors as a literary agent, and studied carbon farming on Maori land in New Zealand. Rosenthal received an MA from Stanford University and a BA from Amherst College. </p>

<p>Wood works directly with partner organisations in Belize who are revising and evaluating the country's coastal management plan, using tools produced by the Natural Capital Project. His scientific research focuses on empirical and mathematical approaches to understanding interactions between humans and the environment in complex socio-ecological networks. This includes studies on patterns of tourism in Belize, ancient human settlement in the Aleutian Islands, and distributions of species interactions in New Zealand and British Columbia.  Previously, Wood participated in a variety of ecological studies on intertidal biodiversity, nearshore wave transformation, coastal sedimentation, and fire recovery.  He earned his PhD from the University of British Columbia and is currently based in Seattle, WA.</p>
