<h3>Enlisting Ecosystem Services: 
Quantification and Valuation of 
Ecosystem Services to Inform Base Management
</h3>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/17th_Field_Artillery_Brigade_-_JBLM.jpg/300px-17th_Field_Artillery_Brigade_-_JBLM.jpg" alt="17th Field Artillery Brigade Fort Lewis"  width="300" /></div>
<p>The Natural Capital Project is collaborating with the Department of Defense (DoD) to develop and customize tools and approaches in order to map and value ecosystem services in diverse ecosystem and military contexts of DoD installations. Better information about the tradeoffs and synergies between land use and ecosystem service provision would help make base management more sustainable, supporting both the ecological environment and the military mission. Using InVEST models, we are customizing natural capital valuation methods for the military context, which demands a balancing of immediate training capacity needs with investments in long-term sustainability. The DoD's exploration of an ecosystem services approach is an important step in enhancing the military decision process to reflect nature's benefits, and in tailoring management strategies to preserve them.</p>

<a name="InVEST" id="InVEST"></a><h3>InVEST will enable decision-makers from all military divisions to:</h3>
<ul>
<br />
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Quantify the importance of natural resources, </li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Reduce conflict between training and natural resource management, and </li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Provide base management with the information they need to plan for the future. </li>
</ul>

<h3>The DoD manages 1% of U.S. lands— over 25 million acres—in more than 425 military installations</h3>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Pakistani_F2000.JPEG/220px-Pakistani_F2000.JPEG" width="300" /> </div>
<p>As the third largest federal land management agency, the DoD has broad influence on resource management practices in the U.S. In addition to land management to facilitate military readiness and training, the DoD is responsible for managing and protecting over 420 species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, including 70 species that are found nowhere else in the world. In an effort to expand its long-term commitment to sustainable development, the DoD initiated a three-year project with the Natural Capital Project, during which ecosystem analyses will be conducted with InVEST on three separate bases: Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM) in Washington State, Ft. Pickett in Virginia, and Ft. Benning in Georgia. </p>

<p>While each of the three bases has distinct ecosystems and resource management issues, they share the imperative to maintain training maneuvers and also mitigate the degradation that results from their operation. We are working with military personnel at all three DoD bases to map ecosystem service provision and value, generate future scenarios under different management objectives, and suggest alternative management strategies. These diverse applications of our approach to ecosystem service mapping and valuation will demonstrate how our tools and approach can be useful on other DoD installations.</p>
<p>An ecosystem services approach enables the value of services the Army receives from ecosystems to be explicit, quantified and maximized. Towards this end, the Natural Capital Project is assisting the DoD in mapping and valuing ecosystem service provision on base, training military personal on the use of our tools and approach, and creating a tailored user's guide for spatial planners at the DoD to continue to use InVEST on their own.</p>

<a name="JBLM" id="JBLM"></a><h3>Evaluating Ecosystem Services at JBLM</h3>
<p>Joint Base Lewis McChord (JBLM) is under pressure to protect the integrity of its prairie and oak woodland habitat, which provide ideal landscape conditions for military training as well as for sensitive species such as Taylor's checkerspot butterfly and  the Mazama pocket
gopher. InVEST will provide planners and managers with knowledge about the trade-offs and synergies to identify the best scenarios to maximize training capacity while protecting the endurance of critical habitats. </p>
<p>We are modeling and mapping four ecosystem services under three future scenarios at JBLM:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Sensitive Species Habitat Risk </b>
- Relative risk to prairie habitat for four candidate species</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Timber Production</b>
- Net value and quantity of timber harvest from natural Douglas fir forest</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Carbon Storage and Sequestration</b>
- Quantity and social value of carbon stored and sequestrated from aboveground biomass in forest, woodland, and prairie ecosystems</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Military Training Capacity</b>
- Relative extent of infantry and vehicle training intensity and supporting natural environment across training zones</li>
</ul>
<br />
<a name="Pickett" id="Pickett"></a><h3>Quantifying and Valuing Ecosystem Services at Fort Pickett</h3>
<p>At Fort Pickett the DoD is particularly interested in protecting the riparian environment from intensive training maneuvers occurring from heavy vehicle activities. They also face the task of managing for endangered and invasive species on base. The Natural Capital Project is using our InVEST software suite to address these challenges holistically, by identifying tradeoffs and synergies among management techniques and their impacts. The Natural Capital Project is also working to assess the potential impacts of future regulations on Army land decisions, particularly those relating to Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) of sediment export. </p>
