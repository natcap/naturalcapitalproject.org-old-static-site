      <h1>Marine Spatial Planning on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, BC</h1>

<p>The West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) in British Columbia, Canada is an astoundingly beautiful place rich in culture and natural resources. The 460 km shoreline of inlets, fjords, sounds and open beaches is fed by an extensive network of rivers and lakes from temperate
rainforests. The region is home to thousands of fish, bird, plant and animal species, and
local communities that rely on these resources for sustenance and livelihood. In spite of
the impressive natural beauty of the area, the Vancouver Island ecosystem faces great
challenges. Salmon populations have decreased dramatically in recent years, levels of
toxics in local food sources are abnormally high, the influence of logging, transportation,
and aquaculture is increasing pressure on the system, and there is uncertainty about
emerging activities such as wave energy.</p>

<p>We are partnering with <a href="http://westcoastaquatic.ca/" target="_blank">West Coast Aquatic</a>, a government and non-government comanagement
body for aquatic resources in WCVI, to use Marine InVEST to inform a more transparent and integrated approach to management of the region. The goal is to create a framework and marine spatial plans in Barkley and Clayoquot Sounds, and waters offshore of the WCVI, agreed upon by all levels of government, First Nations, coastal communities, and private entities.</p> 

<p>In order to address the planning needs in this heavilly marine region, the Natural Capital Project designed a number of new models for our InVEST software suite that can be used in the marine environment. These new models, collectively known as Marine InVEST, will be able to advance planning beyond compartmentalized, sector-specific issues, providing a platform for stakeholder discussions
and negotiations around trade-offs. Our models for the provisioning of salmon from recreational and commercial fisheries, food from salmon net pen and benthic shellfish aquaculture, wave energy generation, protection from erosion and inundation,
recreation for wildlife viewing and our work with collaborators to evaluate cultural services, are all highly relevant to issues facing West
Coast Aquatic and stakeholders on the West Coast of Vancouver Island.</p>

      <p>The Natural Capital Project has teamed-up with the West Coast Aquatic Management Board (<a href="http://westcoastaquatic.ca/" width="300"target="_blank">WCA</a>) to develop a science-based marine spatial plan that allows for the continued delivery of a suite of ecosystem services to Vancouver Island residents now and in the future. WCA and the broader marine conservation community are wrestling with how to take the appealing idea of marine spatial planning and make it practicable.  The framework of ecosystem services and NatCap's metrics for connecting ecosystem well-being to human well-being are bringing stakeholders together around common goals.  Together, WCA and NatCap are highlighting often under-appreciated ecosystem benefits, and allowing for the explicit examination of trade-offs between sectors to improve the health and wealth of Vancouver Island.</p>
