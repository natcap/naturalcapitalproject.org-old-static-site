<h2>Life-Support Systems</h2>
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Coastal Protection:</b> Belize's barrier reefs and mangrove forests act as 'roadblocks' during large storms and hurricanes. By dampening ocean surge along coastlines, these ecosystems decrease costs associated with inundation of coastal developments and erosion.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Recreation and
Tourism:</b> Belize's natural marine environment and extensive coral reefs attract almost one million tourists each year. In 2007, 25% of employed people in Belize worked in the tourism industry.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Fisheries and Aquaculture:</b> Belize is a hotspot for commercial, recreational, and subsistence fishing. The commercial lobster and conch fishery is a $16-20 million/year industry, supporting more than 25,000 Belizean fishers.</li>

<h1>Coastal Belize</h1>

<p>Belize is one of the jewels of the Caribbean, known for its Mayan temples, lush forests, and remarkable coastline. Its coastal zone contains a rich diversity of habitats and attractions, including three offshore atolls, coastal plains and lagoons, mangrove forests, seagrass beds, coral reefs, and over 1000 cayes. This highly productive coastal zone, between land and sea, is home to 35% of the popultion of Belize and endangered species like the West Indian manatee. </p>

<h2>Coastal Environmental Services and Tradeoffs</h2>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/bz02.jpg" alt="© Spencer Wood - Belize" height="215" width="224" /> </div>
<p>
With over 220 km of barrier reef, Belize is home to the planet's second longest unbroken reef system. World-renowned snorkeling and diving draw over 800,000 tourists to the region annually, driving construction of new coastal development, airports, urban areas, and cruise ship ports. The same coastal ecosystems also support several commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries, which maintain the national cuisine: a fusion of West African, Caribbean, and Mexican flavors.  </p>
<p>Clearly, the coastal zone provides a broad range of services to the people of Belize and the world. Now, the challenge is to balance extractive uses, coastal development, and business opportunities with activities that sustain the delivery of these valuable environmental services.</p>

<h2>Coastal Zone Management Plan</h2>

<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/bz03.jpg" alt="© Ian Mackenzie - Xunantunich, Belize http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xunantunich09.jpg" height="188" width="220" /> </div>
<p>
The 1998 passage of visionary legislation establishing the Coastal Zone Management Authority and Institute (<a href="http://www.coastalzonebelize.org/" target="_blank">CZMAI</a>) has created the opportunity to develop a national Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan (ICZMP) in Belize. A partnership between the Natural Capital Project and the CZMAI is bringing together the essential elements of an authoritative ICZMP, including the scientific knowledge, economic valuation, spatial planning, and political and social support necessary to bring this plan to fruition.</p> 
<p>Once completed, the Plan will establish a marine and coastal zoning scheme, preserve national opportunities for sustainable development and economic growth, and promote long-term viability of this treasured barrier reef. The project's overaching objectives are:
</p>
<ul style="margin-left:20px; list-style:disc"
      ><li><p>Consult stakeholders to understand how people use the coastal zone</p></li
      ><li><p>Map and value coastal environmental services</p></li
      ><li><p>Create a revised ICZMP that designates areas for preservation, restoration, development, and other uses</p></li
      ></ul>

<p><a href="http://www.sanpedrosun.com/environment/2012/04/08/czmai-discuss-national-coastal-zone-management-plan/"><b>CZMAI discuss National Coastal Zone Management Plan</a>, April 2012</b></p>
<p>The San Pedro Sun reported on a recent public consultation meeting led by CZMAI to review ecosystem service outcomes of different options for a national Coastal Zone Management Plan. Based on an interview with CZMAI CEO Vincent Gillett, the article describes the planning process and identifies the use of InVEST as a key element in that process: "The module being used is the Marine InVEST which incorporates ecosystem services and valuation approaches into planning. It can inform a variety of policy, managed and conservation approaches ..."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=12154"><b>Belize Moves to Finalize Integrated Coastal Zone Management</a>, January 2012</b></p>
<p>On January 20, 2012, the Amandala newspaper in Belize published an article about our work to develop a coastal zone management plan that takes ecosystem services into account. Journalist Adele O. Trapp extensively interviewed team member Colin Gillett, director of the Coastal Zone Management Institute. Colin notes that the team has "run models of scenarios to explore what is best to do with certain lands within the coastal zone regime," among other advances.</p>

<p><b>Marine InVEST Training, October 2011</b></p>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/belize_training_oct_2011.JPG" width="220"/></div>
<p>The NatCap team co-led a stakeholder training at the Coastal Zone Management Authority and Institute (CZMAI) in late October. In total 24 people were trained, including representative from NGOs throughout Belize and various marine reserve managers for the national Fisheries Department. At the training, CZMAI demonstrated how they are applying InVEST in Belize, showcasing Habitat Risk Assessment, Coastal Vulnerability, Tourism/Recreation, and a new Spiny Lobster model. Participants also had the opportunity to run InVEST on their own computers and provide local knowledge for the development of CZMAI's Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan.</p>

</br>
<p><b>Training and Keynote in Belize, August 2011</b></p>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/IMG_1587.JPG" width="220" /></div>
  <p>In mid August, the NatCap team worked with CZMAI to develop zones for the ICZMP and run InVEST models for Habitat Risk and Coastal Vulnerability. This was followed by a workshop in Placencia (southern Belize) for the MesoAmerican Reef (MAR) Leadership Program. The team introduced Marine InVEST and explored how to integrate environmental services into decision-making and conservation.</p>

<p><b>Planning Workshop with CZMAI held in Belize City, November 8-10, 2010</b></p>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/bz04.jpg" alt="© Spencer Wood - Belize" height="130" width="220" /> </div>
<p>A team from the Natural Capital Project met with colleagues at the CZMAI to identify goals, review methods, identify sources of data, and develop a timeline. The workshop was followed by meetings with partners at other agencies in Belize, and a visit to Goff's Caye which is managed by the CZMAI.</p>
