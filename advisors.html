          </p><p><span class="name">Eric Dinerstein, Ph.D.</span><br />
          <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/experts/eric-dinerstein.html" target="_blank">Chief Scientist and Vice President for Science, World Wildlife Fund</a><br />
          <div class="photo_right"> <img src="images/bios/Dinerstein.jpg" alt="Eric Dinerstein" height="140" /> </div>
		  <p> Dinerstein has led many of WWF&rsquo;s most important scientific ventures, including an effort to identify every ecoregion on the planet and define the most biologically important, a framework called the Global 200 that now guides WWF&rsquo;s fieldwork in more than 100 countries. From tracking tigers and rhinos in Nepal and snow leopards in northern India, to catching and studying fruit bats in Costa Rica, Dinerstein has championed the idea of protecting wildlife beyond park boundaries. Considered groundbreaking at the time, this approach is now standard practice for large-mammal conservation. Eric also is an ardent advocate of forming partnerships with local communities to ensure their support in protecting biodiversity. </p>

		  <p> Ehrlich is a pioneering entomologist and author who is most widely recognized for his work in alerting the public to the perils of overpopulation. At Stanford University, he has pursued long-term studies of the structure, dynamics and genetics of natural butterfly populations, and is co-founder with Peter Raven of the field of co-evolution. Ehrlich is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. His many awards include a MacArthur Prize, the Crafoord Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (given in lieu of a Nobel Prize in areas where the Nobel is not given), the United Nations&rsquo; Sasakawa Environment Prize, and the Blue Planet Prize. </p>

		  <p> Feldman&rsquo;s work on human genetic variation and its relationship to continental ancestry has received wide recognition. He has written more than 335 scientific papers and four books on evolution, ecology, and mathematical biology. Feldman uses applied mathematics and computer modeling to simulate and analyze the process of evolution. He helped develop the quantitative theory of cultural evolution, which he applies to issues in human behavior, and also the theory of niche construction, which has wide applications in ecology and evolutionary analysis. In China, he supervises a large research program on demographic issues related to the gender ratio, and at Stanford, he directs the Morrison Institute for Population and Resource Studies. </p>
