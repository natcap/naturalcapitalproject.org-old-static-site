	  <p>Our mission is to align economic forces with conservation by developing tools that make incorporating natural capital into decisions easy; by demonstrating the power of these tools in important, contrasting places; and by engaging leaders globally.</p>
	  <p>The first tool we are developing models and maps the distribution and flow of ecosystem services across a landscape.</p> 
	  <p>We are developing and testing the tool in the Willamette Valley in Oregon and we are initially applying our approach in demonstration sites, including watersheds in the Sierra Nevada region of California, the Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania, North Shore of O&rsquo;ahu, Hawai&rsquo;i, and the Upper Yangtze River basin in China.</p> 
	  <p>We are developing methods and data to support the modeling of the following ecosystem services: carbon sequestration; pollination; recreation, tourism, and other cultural values; and water-related services such as flow regulation and provision of water quality.</p> 
	  <p>We seek to understand the differences in water quantity, water resources allocation, timing, and quality resulting from changes in land use and climate, and to demonstrate the connections between services affected by changes in hydrologic regime.</p>
	  <p>We seek a water resources and hydrology modeler for a two-year position to assist the Natural Capital Project&rsquo;s Lead Eco-hydrologist in development and calibration of water resources system and hydrology models.</p> 
	  <p>The position is based at Stanford University and includes some travel.</p> 
	  <p>Salary level is commensurate with experience.</p> 
	  <p>This position is not an independent research or work position. Expertise is gained through application and interdisciplinary team collaboration.</p>
