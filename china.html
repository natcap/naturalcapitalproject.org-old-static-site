<h2>Ecosystem Services</h2>
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Flood & Climate Security</b><br />China has invested heavily in reforestation to mitigate flooding and climate change.  Forest cover has increased more in China than in any other part of the world - by 60 million hectares over the past twenty years. Forests around China's Yangtze River Basin sequester an estimated 7.8 billion tons of carbon per year and shelter millions of people downstream from flooding.</li><br />
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Biodiversity</b> <br />Biodiversity loss may be as significant an agent of ecological change as global warming. China harbors 10% of the world's plant and animal species, making its valuation of environmental services critical to global conservation.</li><br />
<li><b>Water Quality</b><br />Beijing's 20 million urban residents depend on surface water supplies. Watersheds filter drinking and irrigation supplies and bolster the efficiency of hydropower production by distributing water flow in rivers. Improving farming practices and other human activities in sensitive areas close to water sources reduces risk of shortages and contamination. </li><br />

<h1>Securing China's Natural Capital</h1>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/ch01.jpg" alt="© Christine Tam - Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, Yunnan, China" height="160" width="250" /></div>
<p>While China harbors 10% of the world's plant and animal species, it is also home to 1.3 billion people whose needs exert high pressure on resources. China is pioneering efforts to balance national economic development with conservation of biodiversity and life support systems to improve and sustain human well-being. Information on ecosystem services, values, and tradeoffs can help inform decision-makers of how alternative policy options will affect ecosystem benefits crucial to economic, health, and other dimensions of well-being.
</p>
<p>Given the eagerness of the Chinese to find and embrace new and innovative solutions, there is no better country in which to make the link between nature and human well being a central tenet of land and water use policy. The Natural Capital Project in China is:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><p>Collaborating with Chinese experts to advance tools and approaches to map and value environmental services tailored to the Chinese context;</p></li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><p>Communicating the essential linkages between humans and the critical life‐support systems that nature provides;</p></li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><p>Cultivating on-the-ground models of application of an environmental services approach at local, regional and national scales. Applications include the Upper Yangtze River, Hainan Island, land-use management in Beijing reservoir's watershed and aiding a 10-year assessment of China's ecosystem services.</p></li>

<h2>InVEST in China</h2>
<p>Researchers employ InVEST, a software suite developed by the Natural Capital Project, to visually map and measure ecosystem services in China. The following massive initiatives establish a new paradigm for integrating ecosystem functions such as water flow regulation, sand storm prevention, and carbon sequestration into national development planning.  They are led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Research Center for Eco-Environmental Science (RCEES).</p>

<h2>Ecosystem Function Conservation Areas </h2>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/efcas.jpg" alt="Figure courtesy of:

" width="500" /></div> 

<p>InVEST is being used in China to help asses services in Ecosystem Function Conservation Areas (EFCAs)—areas with specific development restrictions based on the high levels of ecosystem services they provide. EFCA zoning is a nested process involving government master planning at city, county, provincial, and national scales. The Natural Capital Project is working at each scale. InVEST's sediment retention, water retention and carbon models are being used to estimate and map delivery of these services. The resulting maps are overlaid with biodiversity assessments to identify areas suitable for development with minimum environmental impact. These analyses have so far been used to design EFCAs in Baoxing County in Sichuan Province, Hainan Island, and the upper Yangtze River basin.</p>

<h2>Payments for environmental services (PES) models</h2>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/ch03.jpg" alt="© Christine Tam - Lakeside agriculture, China " height="300" width="225" /></div>
<p>We are informing the assessment of PES programs that aim to preserve water quality in Beijing's surface water reservoir. This watershed is home to over 500,000 households north of Beijing, but is also tasked with providing drinking water to Beijing's 20 million urban residents. This program pays farmers to transition from paddy-land rice agriculture to row-crop agriculture in order to reduce surface water nutrient runoff and promote cultivation of less water-intensive agriculture. By quantifying the program's impacts on natural capital and its value, a clearer assessment of the associated costs and benefits are helping inform future management of the program.</p>

<a name="Livelihoods" id="Livlihoods"></a>
<h2>Ecosystem-dependent livelihoods</h2>
<br />
<p>The Natural Capital Project is engaging in projects with the Xi'an Jiaotong University's Institute for Population and Development Studies looking at how livelihoods are dependent on ecosystem services. Drawing from this group's expertise in rural demography, population dynamics and development, we are developing a framework to integrate measures of human well-being into InVEST and models of ecosystem service delivery more broadly.</p>
<br />
<a name="Capacity" id="Capacity"></a>
<h2>Building science capacity </h2>
<br />
<p>We are cultivating partnerships with influential scientific academics and institutes that specialize in environmental service sciences in China, building on the strong technical foundation the Chinese already have. This will include learning exchanges, trainings, and workshops with Stanford to ensure the science that is being applied is robust, practical, and tailored to the Chinese context. We are also working to better understand factors associated with existing markets for environmental service schemes in China, culling lessons learned to help identify appropriate enabling conditions.</p>
