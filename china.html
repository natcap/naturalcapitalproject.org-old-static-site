<p>The Yangtze River stretches 6,300 kilometers from the high
Tibetan plateau to the East China Sea, winding through the heart of
China. The upper watershed is a particularly critical supplier of
environmental services to the nearly one-tenth of the world’s population
who live in the basin. This fragile environment is changing rapidly,
due to population growth and infrastructure development such as mining,
road-building, and exploitation of regional hydropower resources. Over
the next five years, government leaders will be making critical
conservation and development decisions for the region.</p>
<br />
<h2>Unprecedented economic growth and and 1/5 of the world's
population depend on China's natural capital</h2>
<br />
<p> This “Mother River” of China is not alone in the challenges
it faces. While China harbors 10% of the world’s plant and animal
species, it is also home to 1.3 billion people with needs that exert
high pressure on resources. This most populous country in the world is
experiencing unprecedented growth – roughly a 10% increase per year for
over two decades. This rapid development must be balanced with
conservation of biodiversity and life support systems to improve and
sustain human well being, especially in the wake of devastating floods,
severe water shortages, and increasing desertification and dust storms.</p>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/ch02.jpg" alt="© Christine Tam - Dayaoshan, China " height="305" width="250" /></div>
<p>Better information on environmental services, their values, and
the tradeoffs among them can help support the myriad of policies,
programs, and plans that the Chinese face as they seek harmony between
nature and society. Given the eagerness of the Chinese to find and
embrace new and innovative solutions, there is no better country in
which to make the link between nature and human well being a central
tenet of land and water use policy. </p>
<p>The Natural Capital Project in China is:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><p>Collaborating with
Chinese experts to advance tools and approaches to map and value
environmental services tailored to the Chinese context; </p></li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><p>Cultivating
on-the-ground models of application of an environmental services approach
at local and regional scales, focusing initially on the Upper Yangtze
River (UYRB) and Pearl River basins;</p></li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><p>Communicating about
the essential linkages between humans and the critical life‐support
systems that nature provides.</p></li>
</ol>
<br />
<h2>River basin conservation and development planning </h2>
<p> Working with partners, we are using InVEST to map critical
environmental services (e.g., water retention, soil stabilization, carbon
sequestration) to overlay with biodiversity priorities for the Upper
Yangtze River Basin. This information, impacting a basin of over 400
million people, will feed into provincial conservation and development
planning efforts, most notably Master Planning for biologically diverse
Baoxing County and for the Yangtze River by the Yangtze Water Resources
Commission (<a href="http://eng.cjw.gov.cn/" target="_blank">CWRC</a>)
as well as Biodiversity Action Plan development by the Sichuan and
Qinghai provincial governments.</p>
<br />
<h2>Payments for environmental services (PES) models</h2>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/ch03.jpg" alt="© Christine Tam - Lakeside agriculture, China " height="300" width="225" /></div>
<p>We are informing improvement and expansion of PES programs in
the Pearl River Basin. The Pearl River carries valuable water resources
from poor, biologically-rich mountain areas in south central China to
the wealthy economic powerhouses of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Macau and Hong
Kong in the southeast. The state-level <a href="http://en.cpad.gov.cn/" target="_blank">Poverty
Alleviation and Development Leading Group</a> and the Ministry of
Environmental Protection (<a href="http://english.mep.gov.cn/" target="blank">MEP</a>) are interested in developing
policies to meld biodiversity conservation with protection of ecosystem
services and reduction in poverty, as well as laying out
scientifically-credible guidelines for ecological compensation to
reward suppliers of services.</p>
<br />
<h2>Building science capacity </h2>
<br />
<p>We are cultivating partnerships with influential scientific
academics and institutes that specialize in environmental service sciences
in China, building on the strong technical foundation the Chinese
already have. This will include learning exchanges, trainings, and
workshops with Stanford to ensure the science that is being applied is
robust, practical, and tailored to the Chinese context. We are also
working to better understand factors associated with existing markets
for environmental service schemes in China, culling lessons learned to help
identify appropriate enabling conditions.</p>

<p><b>Environmental Services Modeling Workshop Held in Beijing
September 10-14, 2007</b></p>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/ch04.jpg" alt="© Christine Tam - Jim Regetz (NCEAS) Explaining an Ecosystem Service Model" height="167" width="250" /></div>
<p>The Natural Capital Project team and collaborators from the
National Center for Ecological Assessment and Synthesis (<a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">NCEAS</a>)
met with Chinese scientists, conservation practioners, and government
officials at a workshop co-sponsored by Stanford, China's Ministry of
Environmental Protection (<a href="http://english.mep.gov.cn/" target="_blank">MEP</a>), the Chinese Research Academy
of Environmental Sciences (<a href="http://www.craes.cn/cn/english/welcome.html" target="_blank">CRAES</a>), and the Institute of
Mountain Hazards and Environment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (<a href="http://www.imde.ac.cn/english/english_page.htm" target="_blank">IMHE</a>). The week involved peer
review and discussion of methodologies, tailoring of the Natural
Capital Project approach to China, and actual hands-on application of
InVEST Tier 1 models to the Upper Yangtze River Basin. </p>

Services &amp; Tradeoffs</a>) tool to China, spearheading
policy applications. Technical manuals have already been translated
into Chinese. </p>

<p>“Beijing's strategy for clean water during the Olympics? Pay
rural farmers to 'grow' it. Katherine Ellison explores China's new hope
for conserving the precious natural resources it has left. Last
September...several Chinese government-affiliated scientists met with a
team from the Natural Capital Project - a year-old partnership between
Stanford University, The Nature Conservancy and WWF. The project has
developed mapping and modeling software to pinpoint landscapes where
conservation makes the most sense, a tool that has great potential to
help the Chinese government fine-tune its concept of preserving
'ecological function zones.'”</p>
