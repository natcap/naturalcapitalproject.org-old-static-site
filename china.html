<h1>China</h1>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/ch01.jpg" alt="© Christine Tam - Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, Yunnan, China" height="160" width="250" /></div>
<p>The Yangtze River stretches 6,300 kilometers from the high
Tibetan plateau to the East China Sea, winding through the heart of
China. The upper watershed is a particularly critical supplier of
environmental services to the nearly one-tenth of the world’s population
who live in the basin. This fragile environment is changing rapidly,
due to population growth and infrastructure development such as mining,
road-building, and exploitation of regional hydropower resources. Over
the next five years, government leaders will be making critical
conservation and development decisions for the region.</p>
<br />
<h2>Unprecedented economic growth and and 1/5 of the world's
population depend on China's natural capital</h2>
<br />
<p>This "Mother River" of China is not alone in the challenges it faces. While China harbors 10% of the world's plant and animal species, it is also home to 1.3 billion people with needs that exert high pressure on resources. This most populous country in the world is experiencing unprecedented economic growth – roughly a 10% increase per year for over two decades. China clearly recognizes that this rapid development must be balanced with conservation of biodiversity and life support systems to improve and sustain human well being, especially in the wake of devastating floods, severe water shortages, and increasing desertification and dust storms.</p>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/ch02.jpg" alt="© Christine Tam - Dayaoshan, China " height="305" width="250" /></div>
<p>Given the eagerness of the Chinese to find and embrace new and innovative solutions, there is no better country in which to make the link between nature and human well being a central tenet of land and water use policy. The Natural Capital Project in China is:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><p>Collaborating with Chinese experts to advance tools and approaches to map and value environmental services tailored to the Chinese context;</p></li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><p>Communicating the essential linkages between humans and the critical life‐support systems that nature provides;</p></li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><p>Cultivating on-the-ground models of application of an environmental services approach at local, regional and national scales. Applications include the Upper Yangtze River, Hainan Island, land-use management in Beijing reservoir's watershed and aiding a 10-year assessment of China's ecosystem services.</p></li>
</ol>
<br />
<h2>River basin conservation and development planning </h2>
<p>Working with partners, we are using InVEST to map critical environmental services (e.g., water retention, soil stabilization, carbon sequestration) to overlay with biodiversity priorities for the Upper Yangtze River Basin. This information, impacting a basin of over 400 million people, feeds into provincial conservation and development planning efforts, most notably Master Planning for biologically diverse Baoxing County and for the Yangtze River by the Yangtze Water Resources Commission (<a href="http://eng.cjw.gov.cn/" target="_blank">CWRC</a>)
 as well as Biodiversity Action Plan development by the Sichuan provincial government.</p>
<br />
<h2>Ecosystem Function Conservation Areas </h2>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="china/Hainan-EFCAs.jpg" alt="Zheng, 2012; Hainan Island ecosystem service assessment" width="500" /></div> 

<p>InVEST is being used in China to help asses services in Ecosystem Function Conservation Areas (EFCAs)—areas with specific development restrictions based on the high levels of ecosystem services they provide. EFCA zoning is a nested process involving government master planning at city, county, provincial, and national scales. The Natural Capital Project is working at each scale. InVEST's sediment retention, water retention and carbon models are being used to estimate and map delivery of these services. The resulting maps are overlaid with biodiversity assessments to identify areas suitable for development with minimum environmental impact. These analyses have so far been used to design EFCAs in Baoxing County in Sichuan Province, Hainan Island, and the upper Yangtze River basin.</p>
<br />
<h2>Payments for environmental services (PES) models</h2>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/ch03.jpg" alt="© Christine Tam - Lakeside agriculture, China " height="300" width="225" /></div>
<p>We are informing the assessment of PES programs that aim to preserve water quality in Beijing's surface water reservoir. This watershed is home to over 500,000 households north of Beijing, but is also tasked with providing drinking water to Beijing's 20 million urban residents. This program pays farmers to transition from paddy-land rice agriculture to row-crop agriculture in order to reduce surface water nutrient runoff and promote cultivation of less water-intensive agriculture. By quantifying the program's impacts on natural capital and its value, a clearer assessment of the associated costs and benefits are helping inform future management of the program.</p>
<br />
<h2>Ecosystem-dependent livelihoods</h2>
<br />
<p>The Natural Capital Project is engaging in projects with the Xi'an Jiaotong University's Institute for Population and Development Studies looking at how livelihoods are dependent on ecosystem services. Drawing from this group's expertise in rural demography, population dynamics and development, we are developing a framework to integrate measures of human well-being into InVEST and models of ecosystem service delivery more broadly.</p>
<br />
<h2>Building science capacity </h2>
<br />
<p>We are cultivating partnerships with influential scientific academics and institutes that specialize in environmental service sciences in China, building on the strong technical foundation the Chinese already have. This will include learning exchanges, trainings, and workshops with Stanford to ensure the science that is being applied is robust, practical, and tailored to the Chinese context. We are also working to better understand factors associated with existing markets for environmental service schemes in China, culling lessons learned to help identify appropriate enabling conditions.</p>

<h2>Updates From the Field</h2>

<p><b>Ecosystem Service Assessment Training, June 27-29, 2012</b></p>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/ch04.jpg" alt="© Christine Tam - Jim Regetz (NCEAS) Explaining an Ecosystem Service Model" height="167" width="250" /></div>
<p>China's Ministry of Environmental Protection (<a href="http://english.mep.gov.cn/" target="_blank">MEP</a>) is using InVEST to conduct China's first-ever National Ecosystem Services Assessment, spanning a wide range of ecosystems and geographic scales. The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Research Center for Eco-Environmental Science (RCEES) is leading this effort and will use InVEST to assess changes in ecosystem services from 2000 - 2010. This massive initiative opens a new paradigm for integrating spatially interdependent ecosystem functions such as clean water and carbon storage into national development planning.

<p>This summer, the Natural Capital Project was invited to help train over 200 government land-use managers and scientists from around the country in use and interpretation of InVEST. The InVEST training focused on technical assessment of key ecosystem services related to securing food, water, climate, and biodiversity. The ecosystem assessment training and workshop took place in Beijing, China from June 26-July 2nd and was hosted by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (RCEES).</p>

<p>“Beijing's strategy for clean water during the Olympics? Pay
rural farmers to 'grow' it. Katherine Ellison explores China's new hope
for conserving the precious natural resources it has left. Last
September...several Chinese government-affiliated scientists met with a
team from the Natural Capital Project - a year-old partnership between
Stanford University, The Nature Conservancy and WWF. The project has
developed mapping and modeling software to pinpoint landscapes where
conservation makes the most sense, a tool that has great potential to
help the Chinese government fine-tune its concept of preserving
'ecological function zones.'”</p>
