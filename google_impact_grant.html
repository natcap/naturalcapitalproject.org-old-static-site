<h1>Natural Capital Project Awarded Google Impact Grant</h1>

<p>The Natural Capital Project aims to ensure that decision-makers anywhere in the world have the information they need to account for the value of nature when planning for the future.</p>
<br/>
<p>In support of our work, we are excited to announce a $1.8 million <a href="https://www.google.org/global-impact-awards/natural-capital-project/" target="_blank">Google Impact grant</a>.</p>
<br/>
<p>Nature's role in providing clean water, pollination, climate regulation and countless other ecosystem services is often taken for granted. But increasingly, people are recognizing how nature underpins our livelihoods, health and security.</p>
<br/>
<p>Still, nature's benefits to people have gone largely unmeasured, and this lack of information can hinder efforts to plan responsibly.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>This grant supports the work of The Natural Capital Project's ecologists, economists, and software engineers</b>, who are engaging with communities, companies, institutions and governments to better understand the challenges each face in planning for land use. These challenges include weighing trade-offs between coastal development and fisheries goals; establishing compensation schemes for people; or deciding where and how much to invest in restoration.</p>
<br/>
<p>To meet the needs of these decision-makers, NatCap's computer scientists are developing and, with our users, testing software that makes decisions about nature and development more transparent. Our software models and tools produce metrics and maps that clarify options; reveal the benefits and consequences of various future scenarios; and help people work together to come up with optimal solutions.</p>
<br/>
<p>The software has been co-developed with a diverse array of partners, including lobster fishermen, hoteliers and other stakeholders in Belize; First Nations and fisheries representatives in Vancouver Island; the Chinese government; and the Colombian Ministry of the Environment, among others. We are also collaborating with large financial institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank, to incorporate the consideration of natural capital benefits into its infrastructure and coastal development planning loan decisions.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>"Ultimately what NatCap is doing is trying to use science to help humans make informed decisions about changing landscapes,"</b> said NatCap software architect Rich Sharp. "Almost all humans would really want to know what the landscape was worth before they do something to it.The software is the tool to operationalize that science."</p>

<p>NatCap's software suite, called <a href="http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/InVEST.html" target="_blank">InVEST</a> - Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs - can take an unwieldy amount of data about a place, its natural systems and the people who live there, and translate those data into visual representations that are easy to work with. InVEST can turn analyses that would otherwise take several months into processes that take a few minutes. We continue to refine and add to our software offerings.</p>
<br/>
<p>InVEST now offers 18 individual models, and includes other software tools, each specialized for different analyses. One of the tools, <a href="http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/RIOS.html" target="_blank">RIOS</a>, tracks where and how much to invest in upstream activities, such as protecting forests, changing agricultural practices or replanting vegetation - to keep pollution like sediment and nitrogen out of rivers, and ensure clean, clear water flowing downstream. In South America, where RIOS was first designed and tested, public utilities and private companies dependent on water have used the software to calculate their returns on investment in watershed protection for clean water supplies.</p>
<br/>
<p>Our most recent software model, <a href="http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/OPAL.html" target="_blank">OPAL</a>, can help governments and the private sector design development projects with minimal environmental risk, which also link mitigation benefit to the appropriate communities.</p>
<br/>
<p>The ability to systematically show the connections between ecosystem services and the local people who benefit from them (and who have the most to lose if they go away) is novel, and an issue that's of interest to many of our partners.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Our software engineering team has worked hard to make sure that NatCap's products are widely accessible.</b> Because the software is open source, anyone can look at the code, test the assumptions in the algorithms, and make revisions if needed. Because the algorithms are efficient, the software can run complex analyses over large areas in a few minutes. Because it's free, it can be downloaded by anyone, anywhere. Since January 2012, InVEST has been downloaded 20,000 times by users all around the world.</p>
<br/>
<p>Often, NatCap's engagement in a single planning effort drives interest and awareness throughout the region. For example, in Belize, where coastal development in sensitive habitat could threaten the coral reefs which are central to the country's economy and culture, stakeholders used InVEST software to weigh options, and found ways to both reduce environmental risks while expanding development.</p>
<br/>
<p>The process was so successful that many Caribbean nations are now interested in using InVEST tools as they develop their own coastal plans.</p>
<br/>
<p>"This work helped us identify the best opportunities we have for development while ensuring these ecosystems still provide protection for our coasts, lobster for fishermen, and some of the best snorkeling and diving on the planet," said Chantalle Clarke-Samuels, Director of the Coastal Zone Management Authority and Institute in Belize. "It gave us the information we need to plan for our future."</p>
