<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Coastal Protection</b><br />The Primeiras e Segundas Protected Area includes over 140 miles of exposed coastline, protected from storms and sea-level rise by extensive mangroves and coral reefs.</li><br />
<li><b>Tourism </b><br />Tourism in the Primeiras e Segundas is undeveloped, as the region is remote. However, tourism revenue in Mozambique as a whole is an important service, and in recent decades has been the fastest-growing sector of the nation's economy. </li><br />

<h1>Designing a Mangement Program in Mozambique</h1>

<p>The Natural Capital Project (NatCap) has partnered with the World Wildlife Fund/Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (WWF/CARE) Alliance, Mozambique's Ministry of Fisheries, and the Ministry of Tourism of Mozambique, lending its technical and science support to create a management plan for the newly-designated Primeiras e Segundas Protected Area. The plan will inform the government of Mozambique on how to allow for multiple uses in the Primeiras e Segundas region, without degrading the ecosystem functions and services that local people depend on. The goal of NatCap's engagement is to create a plan, with its own scientific tools and expertise, and with WWF-CARE's on-the-ground experience and engagement with stakeholders, for the managed and sustainable use of coastal resources. The final plan is scheduled for release in June of 2014.</p>

<p>In addition to the Primeiras e Segundas project, NatCap has started collaboration with Mozambique's Ministry of the Environment to integrate natural capital into Mozambique's Green Economy Action Plan, working to grow Mozambique's economy while protecting its natural resources.

<h3>Managing resources for today and for tomorrow</h3>

<p>The Primeiras e Segundas Protected Area is Mozambique's first Environmental Protection Area, encompassing a stretch of coastline from the town of Pebane to north of the city of Angoche, stretching nearly 12 miles inland and including all 10 of the islands in the Primeiras and Segundas archipelago, for a total of over 4,020 square miles. Ecosystems within the preserve include seagrass beds, coral reefs, seabird and sea turtle nesting grounds, mangroves, estuaries, and a deepwater drop-off, and contains habitat for vulnerable species such as dugong and green sea turtles.</p>
<p>
The Primeiras e Segundas is a multi-use area. More than 340,000 people live within the Primeiras e Segundas region, many of them dependent directly on the land for their livelihoods. Employment rates are low, and local livelihoods are primarily dependant on a combination of agriculture and artisanal fishing. There are currently 30,000 registered artisanal fishermen in the region. The increasing size of the fishing fleet and the prevalence of illegal fishing methods, such as use of fine netting that catches even the smallest fish, have put unsustainable pressure on local fish populations. Over-harvesting of firewood from mangroves is also of concern. In addition, commercial mining of mineral sands takes place in the region, but the ecosystem impacts of sand mining are poorly understood.</p>
<p>Local people living in the Primeiras e Segundas region have noticed changes in rainfall, fish abundance, and other aspects of their environment. These changes could be traced to over-harvesting and climate change, highlighting the need to preserve resources for the next generation while still having enough to live off of today. In working to make an equitable and sustainable management plan, local fishermen, commercial fishermen, and sand mining interests will be engaged as stakeholders during the Primeiras e Segundas plan's creation.</p>

<h2>An Opportunity on Multiple Scales</h2>
<p>The WWF-CARE Alliance has been working with the government for over a decade to establish the Primeiras e Sugundas Protected Area, with both social and ecological goals. The partnership approached NatCap to contribute expertise to the Primeiras e Segundas management plan, as well as for future work with the Green Economy Action Plan. Since then, NatCap has been working to support their efforts to manage and value Mozambique's resources on both a local and a national level.</p>
<p>In early September of 2013, the WWF-CARE Alliance invited Natural Capital Project team members to a conservation action planning workshop in Angoche. This workshop gave NatCap and its partners an opportunity to discuss the fundamentals of ecosystem services, and explore how giving value to services can guide management plans.</p>
<p>NatCap has identified fisheries, tourism, coastal defense, water yield, and sediment retention as key ecosystem services to focus on in the Primeiras e Segundas, and, using InVEST, has produced preliminary results for the distribution and provision of these services in the region. These baseline assessments of key services are providing information for the first draft of the management plan. Future work may entail modeling different management scenarios and assessing the trade-offs in ecosystem services.</p>
