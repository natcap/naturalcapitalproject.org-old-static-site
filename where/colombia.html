<h1>Permitting, Mitigation, and Ecosystem Services in Colombia</h1>
<div class="photo_right"><p style="margin-left:10px"><img src="../images/colombiawf.jpg" alt="Fencing for a water fund in Colombia"/></p> </div>
<p>The Natural Capital Project is working on several projects in Colombia that involve incorporating ecosystem service information directly into decisions that impact the environment. Through our partnership with The Nature Conservancy (TNC), we are working with the Colombian government on incorporating the provision of ecosystem services into environmental impact statements and permitting and mitigation decisions. Our work in the Cauca Valley on prioritizing investments in watershed services led to the development of <a href="../RIOS.html">RIOS</a>, a software tool to support water fund design and management, as well as our current work in the region on developing a monitoring program for water funds. We are also working with our partners at WWF to develop compensatory mechanisms for ecosystem service loss and analyzing how key services would be impacted by climate change. </p>

<a name="Mitigation" id="Mitigation"></a><br />
<h2>Including Ecosystem Services in Permitting & Mitigation</h2>
<p>Colombia has established ambitious federal regulation protecting natural environments that requires new development projects to mitigate and compensate people for any negative environmental impacts they have to ecosystem services and the environment (<a href ="http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=16316" target="_blank">Decree 1220</a>, 2005). To aid the fulfillment of this requirement, scientists at NatCap and TNC are collaborating to create a  standardized approach to include ecosystem services alongside biodiversity in environmental impact assessment and mitigation for terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems in Colombia. NatCap is also developing a software tool that will allow the Ministry of Environment and companies seeking environmental licenses for mining, transportation and other development projects to apply this approach for terrestrial ecosystem services and biodiversity.</p>
<p>NatCap scientists first demonstrated the benefits of including ecosystem services in impact assessment and mitigation processes by evaluating impacts of new and proposed coal mine permits on drinking water quality regulation services in the Cesar Department in northern Columbia. <a href="../models/models.html">InVEST models </a>were used to evaluate the potential to mitigate impact to communities through protection or restoration. In a report to the Colombian Ministry of the Environment, NatCap scientists showed which areas analyses suggest mitigation is likely to offset the impacts of mine expansion, and for which mines full mitigation is not possible. NatCap's efforts to create a standardized approach and decision support tool for permitting and mitigation builds on this work in Cesar. This tool is being built to be used by the Ministry on a national scale in Colombia, but it will be designed to be used in permitting and mitigation decisions almost anywhere in the world.</p>

<h2>Water Fund Investments in the Cauca Valley</h2>
<div class="photo_right"><p style="margin-left:10px"><img src="../images/colombiawf2.jpg" alt="Farming in a water fund in Colombia" 
/></p> </div>
<p>NatCap works with TNC, Asocaña (an association of sugar cane producers), CVC (the local environmental authority) and local watershed associations in supporting the operation and monitoring of a <a href = "../decisions/waterfunds.html" target="_blank">water fund</a> in Colombia's East Cauca Valley. Founded in 2009, the Fondo de Agua por la Vida y la Sostenibilidad (<a href="http://www.aguaycambioclimatico.org/fotos/evento_elemento/0Fondo%20Agua%20por%20la%20Vida%20y%20la%20Sostenibilidad_Amalia%20Morales.pdf">FAVS</a>), or Water Fund for Life and Sustainability, aims to secure biodiversity and water-related service benefits including sediment retention and maintenance of regular water flows. </p>
<p>To direct FAVS' investments to areas with high potential for positive socioeconomic and environmental impact, NatCap developed new ecosystem service ranking models to compare the returns of investment in various conservation activities. Tests of this <a href = "../RIOS.html" target="_blank">multi-objective maximization approach</a> resulted in observed changes in ecosystem services up to six times greater than previous ad-hoc investments. The approach was applied to design water fund investments that are robust to changing climate conditions as well.</p>
<p>The fund currently supports watershed protection activities, environmental education programs, forest enrichment and restoration, and improved farming practices. These activities are securing water services for over a million residents downstream, conserving at least 125,000 ha of natural ecosystems, and benefiting sugar cane production, a key industry in Colombia. </p> 
<p>NatCap is also partnering with TNC to support monitoring of the fund's activities, to demonstrate that changes in land management can impact the delivery of ecosystem services at various scales.   Monitoring work in Colombia is part of a larger program to support the design of effectiveness monitoring for watershed management activities throughout Latin America.</p><br />

<h2>Climate Adaptation & Ecosystem Services</h2>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/CHARCO_DEL_INDIO_VILLAGARZON_PUTUMAYO.jpg/800px-CHARCO_DEL_INDIO_VILLAGARZON_PUTUMAYO.jpg" alt="Iroz. SALTO O CHARCO DEL INDIO, EN LAS INMEDIACIONES DE VILLGARZON PUTUMAYO." height="200" width="300" /></div>

<p>In the Upper Putumayo basin of Colombia's Sibundoy Valley, NatCap and partners at World Wildlife Fund (WWF) work with the regional environmental regulatory agency, <a href= "http://www.corpoamazonia.gov.co/" target="_blank"> Corpoamazonía</a>, and the  Foundation Center for Sustainable Agricultural Systems (<a href = "http://www.cipav.org.co/" target="_blank">CIPAV </a>), a nonprofit research organization, to analyze key ecosystem services and inform long-term conservation schemes and climate adaptation plans.</p>
<p>To understand the impacts of emerging development on ecosystem services and the expected intensification of these effects under climate change, <a href="../models/models.html">InVEST models</a> were used to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
<b>Quantify the provision of regionally important ecosystem services </b> including <a href="../models/hydropower.html">water yield</a>, capacity for <a href= "../models/carbon.html">carbon sequestration</a>, <a href= "../models/water_purification.html">nutrient retention</a> and <a href= "../models/sediment_retention.html">erosion control</a>;</li>
<li style="margin=bottom: 10px;">
<b>Analyze the change in water supply and erosion control</b> under two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios of altered temperature and precipitation. </li>
</ul><br />
<p>Scientists identified areas with the highest concentration of ecosystem services, the greatest risk of services losses from incompatible activities, or the greatest potential to increase services with conservation measures. Select locations are being integrated into a compensation and rewards for ecosystem services (CRES) scheme, a method of contracting payment among beneficiaries and stewards of ecosystems, used to enhance service provisioning or mitigate degradation.</p>
<p> WWF Colombia and partners have also selected pilot locations for silvopastoral systems, in which forestry management practices are integrated with managed grazing of livestock. With the support of InVEST models, scientists quantified how these alternative livestock production systems would likely impact agricultural revenues, drinking water quality to local aqueducts, erosion control, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity. The results were used by <a href= "http://www.corpoamazonia.gov.co/" target="_blank"> Corpoamazonía</a> to select areas for directing compensation payments to ranchers implementing silvopasture practices, to determine baselines for ecological monitoring, and to identify the areas in which ecosystem services are most threatened by climate change.</p>
