<h2>Ecosystem Services</h2>
<ul>
<b>Drinking Water</b>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Watersheds are critical to providing safe water to urban centers. Improved land-use practices reduce erosion and nutrient pollution, cleaning water supplies for users downstream. Beyond what flows from the tap, clean water arriving at cities is also used to make bottled drinks such as sodas and beer.</li>
<b>Flood Protection</b>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Water fund investments in natural capital can slow overland flow of water and increase travel time of water to the river, decreasing the peak magnitude of floods. Reducing peak flow can reduce damage to infrastructure and private property, and reduce risk to human life. </li>
<b>Hydropower</b>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Erosion control that keeps sediment out of waterways can also keep sediment from settling in reservoirs where it can reduce the production capacity of hydropower facilities, shorten the lifetime of the reservoir, or increase dredge costs.</li> 
<b>Poverty Alleviation</b>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Some water funds have social objectives in addition to biophysical goals of securing water supplies. For example, the World Bank has assessed the potential to use payments from water funds as a means to alleviate rural poverty in Guatemala.</li>
</ul>

<div class="photo_right"><img src="../images/nta_15.jpg" alt="Â© TNC-Northern Tropical Andes (Bridget Besaw and Diego Ochoa)" height="144" width="250" /> </div>
<p>The Natural Capital project supports water funds across Latin America to represent the interests of multiple stakeholders and maximize the water-related benefits of improved land management. Water Funds gather contributions from water users to finance conservation and to help secure water quality and quantity.</p>
<p>Our work in Latin America aims to create a scientifically rigorous, yet flexible return on investment approach to guide water fund design and fund investments. Based on the lessons and best practices from across the region, we developed a standardized, scientific approach to managing water fund investments that is applicable in any location.</p>

<h2>Water Fund Investments in Latin America</h2>
<div class="photo_left"><a href="../images/WF_map_2013.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/WF_map_2013.jpg" alt="updated water funds map" width="200" border= "2"/></a> </div>
<p>The Natural Capital Project is working with the <a href= "http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/latinamerica/latin-american-water-funds-partnership.xml">
Latin American Water Funds Partnership</a> (The Nature Conservancy, Inter-American Development Bank, Global Environment Facility and FEMSA Foundation) in the design and development of water funds througout the region, and in the development of RIOS, a science-based software tool to standardize water fund investment design. 
<p>In 2011 the Latin American Water Funds Partnership committed to developing 32 new water funds in Latin America over five years, pledging $27 million to restore over seven million acres of watersheds. <p/>
<p>Water funds are a finance mechanism for watershed conservation and provision of clean, ample water. Beneficiaries of a watershed make financial contributions to a fund that is used to promote conservation activities including protection, restoration, and best management practices in crop and pasture lands. Water funds work when these activities supply water, and provide purification and regulation services at lower costs than other forms of treatment and flow regulation such as dams and water treatment plants.</p>
<p> 
Today there are over 30 water funds in operation or in designing stages (<a href="../images/WF_map_2013.jpg" target="_blank">map above</a>). 10 additional locations are being evaluated for their potential to initiate funds. <a href= "http://www.fondosdeagua.org/%C2%BFd%C3%B3nde-trabajamos"> Click here </a>for detailed information and updates on individual water funds.</p>

<a name="RIOS" id="RIOS"></a>
<h2>RIOS: Resource Investment Optimization System</h2>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="../images/cc/RIOS-IP.jpg" alt="Investment portfolio" /></div>
<p>Some water fund investors are using NatCap's <a href="../RIOS.html">RIOS software</a> to support their funding decisions. RIOS produces a portfolio with investment options ranked by data on an activity's cost, feasibility, and expected effectiveness given the physical setting and current land use near a watershed.</p>
<p> RIOS builds on the experiences of existing water funds to develop a standardized and flexible approach to water fund design and investment.  Our approach values the environmental returns on watershed investments through hydrological models while accounting for preferences and requirements of stakeholders.</p>
<p>RIOS was co-designed with users to improve returns from conservation investments based on a combination of biophysical, social and economic data. The tool has been tested in several emerging water funds across Latin America and has proven useful for managers and flexible enough to apply in different environmental, social, and legal contexts.  The tools is free and designed for companies, consultants, government agencies or non-government organizations to use in the development of water fund investments.  RIOS quantifies returns for some of the most desired water benefits including erosion control, water purification, and flood mitigation.  Our goal for RIOS is to provide a standardized approach to water fund design and investment prioritization in contexts throughout the world.</p>

<h2>Early Testbeds of Science-based Investing</h2>
<p>In order to value water services from the watershed, identify priority sites for investment in the watersheds to secure those services, and set up monitoring programs for these water funds, feasibility and design studies were developed and run with technical support from NASCA
Science and Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (<a href="http://www.ciat.cgiar.org/">CIAT</a>).</p>
<p><a href="../InVEST.html">InVEST</a>, SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), and FIESTA (Fog Interception for the
Enhancement of Stream flow in Tropical Areas) models were run using data from the watershed in the East Cauca Valley in Colombia, where our <a href="../images/RIOS_approach_CaucaValley.jpg">approach to science-based investing</a> was first tested. Model results have helped determine critical areas in the watershed for immediate water fund investments. In addition, comparison of model results is helping to inform the use of InVEST for water fund projects throughout the region.

<h2>Preliminary Results</h2>
<br />
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Built capacity across water funds,</b> and trained technical specialists and fund managers from 16 water funds throughout Latin America. Provide continued scientific counsel to high-level managers and project implementers.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Launched <a href= "../RIOS.html">RIOS</a> (Resource Investment Optimization System) software tool</b> in 2013, to standardize water funds investment design and maximize ecological returns on investment. The tool has been tested in several emerging water funds and has proven useful for managers and flexible enough to apply in different environmental, social, and legal contexts. </li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Expanding water funds globally:</b> Our goal is to provide a scientific approach to incorporating ecosystem services in water fund design and conservation investment throughout the world. A water fund has recently been established to ensure a continuing supply of clean water to the city of Nairobi, Kenya. NatCap is also working with partners to demonstrate the utility of an ecosystem services approach for Beijing, China.</li>
