<p>Since 2013, NatCap has provided  scientific guidance and support to the Center for Studies and Conservation of  Natural Heritage, a nongovernmental organization known by its acronym in  Spanish, <a href="http://www.cecpan.org/">CECPAN</a>. This  collaboration, funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, backs  initiatives to conserve various elements of cultural and natural heritage in the archipelago of Chiloé in Southern Chile.  NatCap continues to guide CECPAN staff in how to use our approach  and tools, apply InVEST models in novel ways to address their needs, and  provide feedback on several conservation initiatives. </p>

<h2>Our Work Together in Chiloe</h2>
<br />
<h3>Designating the Lacuy Peninsula as a Zone of Tourist Interest</h3>

<p>
  In one of its current  initiatives, CECPAN collaborates with the National Tourism Service (SERNATUR),  the Municipality of Ancud, the Association of Tourism of Ancud, and the broader  community to designate the Lacuy Peninsula as a Zone of Tourist Interest. Colonies  of Humboldt and Magellanic penguins, among other marine fauna, draw more than  19,000 visitors annually to this region of significant natural and cultural  heritage. Consequently, tourism and recreation constitute a vital piece of the  local economy. Given that a large portion of the peninsula is now under  consideration for a major wind farm project, CECPAN is working to ensure that  impacts to recreation, shorebirds, and local communities are taken into account  during decision making processes. CECPAN applied the InVEST Recreation and  Scenic Quality models to show decision makers how important the region is  for recreation and tourism, and how important the peninsula could prove in the  future. The goal of this collaboration is to officially recognize the Lacuy  Peninsula's role in recreation and tourism. Its designation as a Zone of  Tourist Interest will help conserve the coastal ecosystems that support local  communities.</p>

<h3>Preserving Agricultural Herritage</h3>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Papas_de_colores_de_Chiloe.jpg" alt="Chiole potatoes (cc) Avodrocc" width="250" /></div>
<p>
  Elsewhere on the archipelago,  CECPAN is demonstrating the value of rural land in an effort to regulate urban  sprawl and preserve small scale farming. Chiloé's ancestral farming practices,  including the cultivation of some 200 varieties of native potatoes, garnered  recognition as a Global Important Agricultural Heritage System by FAO and  UNESCO. CECPAN is working with the Agricultural Development Institute (INDAP)  and Local Development Programs (PRODESAL), the Municipality of Castro, the  National Forest Corporation (CONAF), the Center of Education and Technology  (CET), and small scale farmers to promote farming practices that reduce soil  erosion, including hedges of native forest. CECPAN applied the Sediment  Retention model to show the benefits of a best management practices scenario. This  collaboration aims to secure and leverage government funds to promote these practices  that conserve soil, and, in turn, agricultural heritage.</p>
<br />
<h3>Protecting Wetlands for Shorebirds</h3>
<p>
  In these same sites, CECPAN is  using the Habitat Risk Assessment model to project the effects of a business as  usual scenario of urban sprawl into rural wetlands near Castro, the capital of  the Chiloé province. These coastal wetlands serve as critical habitat for  migratory shorebirds and underscore a need for careful planning that regulates  residential development in rural areas adjacent to city perimeters. In collaboration  with the Municipality of Castro and local residents, CECPAN is working to  ensure that considerations of critical habitat enter into zoning measures.
<br />

<h3>Protecting Endangered Species</h3>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Pseudalopex_fulvipes-primer_plano.jpg" alt="Darwin's Fox (cc) Fernando Bórquez" width="250" /></div>
<p>
  One of the next projects CECPAN plans to tackle concerns Darwin's Fox (Zorro de Darwin), a critically endangered fox that is only found on Chiloe Island and in a nearby area on the mainland. Only about 250 Darwin's Foxes are left in the world, the vast majority of which live on Chiloe Island. Mainland foxes are threatened by the invasive American mink that competes with the fox for food; locals are concerned that the mink will invade Chiloe Island as well. CECPAN is planning to use the InVEST Habitat Risk Assessment model to pinpoint areas on Chiloe Island that would be prime habitat for the mink, identifying areas at most risk for invasion. This invasion assessment can then be used to concentrate monitoring and control efforts in locations most likely to contain minks. <br />
