  <p>Bhagabati leads WWF's efforts to apply InVEST in priority field sites. He developed an interest in conservation growing up in the biodiversity-rich region of northeast India near the Eastern Himalayas. After completing undergraduate work in India in biology and computer science, Bhagabati pursued doctoral research at the State University of New York, studying geographic variation in birds (Mexican Jays) in the southwestern US and northern Mexico. Subsequently, he studied the genetics of an avian hybrid zone at the Smithsonian Institution, and then worked as a bioinformatics analyst at The Institute for Genomic Research, where he developed software, analyzed data, and trained biologists in data analysis. Bhagabati also has a degree in Sustainable Development and Conservation Biology from the University of Maryland. He has worked with several environmental organizations, including the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, Conservation International, the National Wildlife Federation and World Wildlife Fund, on diverse projects including GIS-based analyses of human dimensions of conservation, biofuels, tropical deforestation and climate change policy, and landscape-level conservation planning.</p>

  <div class="photo_right"><img src="../images/bios/barano_sulistyawan.jpg" alt="Oki Hadian" height="140" /></div>
   <p>Barano has been working with WWF Indonesia since 1996. He started as a research coordinator of Wasur National Park Project at WWF Indonesia Program in district Merauke of Papua province of Indonesia. He has a degree in Biology from Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta. In 1999, he worked on freshwater issues on the lakes and rivers of Papua; a priority place for WWF-Indonesia. At same time, he became involved in the ecoregional planning approach for large landscape conservation programme. In 2002, Barano returned to the same university to continue with a Masters Degree in Remote Sensing; where TM & ETM land satellite images were used to measure and monitor water hyacinth populations in the Maro river. Upon graduation, he continued to utilize the ecoregional planning approach at the TransFly ecoregion in Papua, by including the mapping of community land values, ecological and social values into the spatial plan.</p>
   <p>In 2008, Barano was promoted to lead the Conservation Spatial Plan programme which led to him collaborating with the Natural Capital teams and applying the InVEST tool for Indonesia, starting in Sumatra. He has since completed the Stanford University training on InVEST and is looking to expand the use of InVEST to the Heart of Borneo and the southern part of Papua.</p>
