<h2>Ecosystem Services</h2>
<ul>
<br />
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Military Training:</b> The DoD maintains diverse environments for on-base training. Spatial managers must balance priorities to preserve landscapes for intensive training maneuvers and also protect habitats and limit invasive species.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Sensitive Species:</b> The DoD is responsible for protecting over 420 species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA, and over 500 at-risk species that inhabit lands on military installations. DoD lands are also home to over 70 species that are found nowhere else in the world.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Timber Production:</b> Some DoD installations conduct forest thinning and clear cutting to create training sites and species habitat. Harvested timber is also sold by installations for income.  </li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Carbon Storage & Sequestration:</b> Trees and grasslands store carbon in their standing stocks and sediments, creating long-term reservoirs of sequestered carbon on DoD bases.</li> 
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Sediment Retention:</b> Vegetation holds soil in place and captures sediment moving over land. Bases such as Ft. Pickett and Ft. Benning must monitor sediment flow to comply with water quality regulations.</li>

<b>Enlisting Ecosystem Services: 
Quantification and Valuation of 
Ecosystem Services to Inform Base Management

<div class="photo_right"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/17th_Field_Artillery_Brigade_-_JBLM.jpg/300px-17th_Field_Artillery_Brigade_-_JBLM.jpg" alt="17th Field Artillery Brigade Fort Lewis"  width="300" /></div><p>The Natural Capital Project (NatCap) is collaborating with the Department of Defense (DoD) to develop tools and approaches that map and value ecosystem services in diverse ecosystems and military contexts of DoD installations. Using <a href="../models/models.html">InVEST models</a>, we are customizing natural capital valuation methods to suit the military environment, which demands attention to immediate training capacity needs as well as investments in long-term resource planning. </p>
<br />
<h3>The DoD manages 1% of U.S. lands— over 25 million acres—in more than 425 military installations</h3>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Pakistani_F2000.JPEG/220px-Pakistani_F2000.JPEG" width="300" /> </div>
<p>
In 2011 the DoD initiated a three-year pilot project with NatCap to advance its pursuit of sustainable development practices. Ecosystem analyses are being conducted with InVEST on three bases: Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM) in Washington State, Ft. Pickett in Virginia, and Ft. Benning in Georgia. NatCap will work with military personnel at all three DoD bases to map ecosystem service provision and value, to specify tradeoffs between training activities and environmental regulation compliance, and to generate future scenarios under different management objectives. 
 </p>
 <br />
<h3>As the third largest federal land management agency, the DoD has broad influence on U.S. resource management practices</h3>
<p>Military training areas, spanning over 25 million acres, represent many different ecosystems in the US. These lands are home to over 420 species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and another 500 at-risk species that could be added without proper management. The DoD's exploration of an ecosystem services approach is a critical step in enhancing their decision process to reflect nature's benefits, and in tailoring strategies to preserve them. </p>


<a name="InVEST" id="InVEST"></a><h3>InVEST will help decision makers from all military divisions to:</h3>
<ul>
<br />
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Quantify</b> the relative importance of natural resources on base</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Manage conflict</b> between training and safeguarding natural resources </li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Plan for the future</b> resource needs of US military base management</li>
</ul>
<br /> <br />
<h2>A Forward-Thinking Mission</h2>
<p>The US military is transitioning from a compliance-based environmental program to a mission-oriented sustainability approach as it plans for projected changes in force structure and training. NatCap is working with DoD decision makers to improve the efficiency of base management and ensure the value of ecosystem services from which the military benefits is explicit, quantified and maximized. Running InVEST scenarios will assist the military as it changes over the next decades to conduct new types of training, use new equipment, and increase training capacity. </p>

<a name="JBLM" id="JBLM"></a><h3>Evaluating Ecosystem Services at JBLM</h3>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="../images/JBLM_Baseline.jpg" alt="JBLM Baseline" /></div><p>Joint Base Lewis McChord (JBLM) is under pressure to protect the integrity of its prairie and oak woodland habitats, which provide ideal landscape conditions for a variety of Army training needs (e.g., open areas for off-road maneuvers and digging activities) as well as for sensitive species such as the Taylor's Checkerspot butterfly and the Mazama pocket gopher. InVEST is providing planners at JBLM with knowledge about the trade-offs and synergies of management strategies in order to maximize training capacity while protecting critical habitats.modeling and mapping four ecosystem services under three future scenarios at JBLM:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Sensitive Species Habitat Risk </b>
- Relative risk to prairie habitat for four candidate species</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Timber Production</b>
- Net value and quantity of timber harvest from natural Douglas fir forest</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Carbon Storage and Sequestration</b>
- Quantity and value of carbon stored and sequestrated from aboveground biomass in forest, woodland, and prairie ecosystems</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Military Training Capacity</b>
- Relative extent of infantry and vehicle training intensity and supporting natural environment across training zones</li>
</ul>
<br />
<a name="Pickett" id="Pickett"></a><h3>Ecosystem Services at Fort Pickett</h3>
<p>At Fort Pickett the DoD must undertake measures to protect the environment from intensive training maneuvers, particularly those occurring from heavy vehicle activities. They must also manage endangered species such as the Michaux's Sumac, control erosion impacting threatened freshwater species of the Nottoway River, and manage a vast network of associated wetland areas. NatCap is currently exploring land management scenarios to fulfill these responsibilities and comply with environmental regulations.</p>
<br />
<a name="Results" id="Results"></a><h2 style="margin: 10px 0pt 0pt;">Preliminary Results</h2>
<p>Better information about the tradeoffs and synergies between land use and ecosystem service provision is helping render DoD base management more sustainable. An integrated approach to resource management and natural capital valuation bolsters both the ecological environment and the military mission. So far, our work with the DoD has focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Developing</b> a new prototype model for military training as an ecosystem service </li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Training</b> military personnel on the use of our tools and approach</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Creating</b> a tailored user's guide for military spatial planners to continue using InVEST</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Modeling & Mapping</b> key ecosystem services on base under future management scenarios</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Informing</b> practical strategies to maintain diverse landscapes necessary for military training and regulatory compliance</li>
</ul>
