<h2>Ecosystem Services</h2>
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Wind Energy</b><br /> The coast of New England has high offshore wind speeds and is close to city centers, making it prime grounds for offshore wind farms. However, there are a number of other, often conflicting, uses of the offshore habitat, and any need for new renewable energy facilities needs to be balanced and sited to reduce conflicts with existing uses.</li><br />
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Scenic Quality </b> <br />The location of new windfarm facilities is being influenced by the impact they have on views from shore. We are using our new scenic quality model to determine their viewshed (where they can be seen). These viewfields can be used to determine where to site turbines so as to minimize their visual impact on surrounding populations. </li><br />
<li><b>Coastal Vulnerability </b><br />Faced with a changing climate and a growing intensity of human activities, in planning for future coastal development, it is important to understand how modifications of the biological and physical environment (i.e. direct and indirect removal of natural habitats for coastal development) can affect coastal exposure to storm-induced erosion and flooding. </li><br />
<li><b>Fisheries </b><br />New England was once considered the heart of America's fishing industry, and although the industry is not what it once was, it still has many prime fishing grounds that support fishermen and fishing communities on shore. We are using InVEST to find hotspots across fishing fleets in New England, for comparison with profit hotspots from wind energy generation.  We are also developing a model to quantify how fishing fleets may change where they fish in response to shifts in fish distribution and abundance associated with effects of climate change.</li><br />
<li><b>Shellfish</b><br />Shellfish harvestingis a very important and lucrative industry in New England, and  often occurs in areas that also happen to be good sites for wind farms. Shellfish also filter large amounts of water, improving water quality.  </li><br />

<h1>Informing Marine Planning in New England</h1>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="../images/windfarm.jpg" alt="Windfarm"  /></div>
<p>The Natural Capital Project (NatCap) is providing assistance to several groups in New England in support of marine planning in the region. The waters of the Northeastern U.S. are intensively used for marine transportation, commercial and recreational fisheries, recreational boating, and many others. Recent state and federal emphasis on the development of renewable energy resources--which in the Northeast centers on offshore wind--has accelerated regional interest in strategic planning of existing and anticipated ocean uses. NatCap is working to map and value a range of ecosystem services in the region to ensure that decision makers have scientifically valid information to use for renewable energy siting decisions and for broader marine planning efforts.</p>

<p>A critical component of this engagement to date has been the development of an offshore wind energy model as part of the InVEST software. The model predicts wind power generation, costs, and revenue over space and flexibly incorporates user-specified wind farm designs and economic inputs. Our model and data collection efforts (data tables are distributed with the model) allow for new advances in understanding costs and exploring the net present value (a metric of profitability) of wind farms in various potential locations.  In addition, our modeling approach can enhance siting decisions by considering other ocean uses. We are overlaying spatially explicit wind energy value information with maps of other ocean uses to assess likely tradeoffs between user groups and to explore siting opportunities that lead to win-wins. Although the wind energy model was developed to enhance decision making in New England, the InVEST wind energy model comes with worldwide wind energy datasets to ensure its utility in other locations.</p>
<p>Closer to shore, we are examining how coastal habitats protect people and property from sea-level rise and storms.  Particularly after hurricane Sandy, there is significant interest in this theme throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic.  We are applying the InVEST Coastal Vulnerability model to map where habitats are providing the most protection.</p>

<h2>Our work in New England</h2>
<div><img src="../images/NE-NPV.jpg" alt="New England Wind farm"  /></div>
<br />
<p>Our work in New England is multifaceted.  Currently, we are:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 20px;"> 
<li>Conducting a regional analysis that synthesizes data and information about the offshore wind resource, profitability of turbines, and overlap of economically feasible locations for wind energy facilities with existing ocean uses. It is our hope that this analysis can inform discussions about the siting of offshore wind facilities.  We are using the newly developed InVEST wind energy model, the InVEST aesthetic quality model, and the InVEST Overlap Analysis for this analysis.  </li><br />
<li>Exploring how proposed turbines off the coast of Block Island, Rhode Island are likely to impact views from the island and potentially indirectly affect property values and tourism. This kind of information has the potential to enable new kinds of communication within communities wrestling with the costs and benefits of offshore renewable energy. </li> <br />
<li>Mapping where coastal habitats provide protection for people and property from sea-level rise and storms from New Jersey to Maine. This regional perspective will highlight where coastal habitats are providing important protective services and can help target conservation and restoration activities.  This effort is a finer-scale analysis using <a href="../decisions/arkema_coastdefense.html">an approach we have applied to shorelines</a> along the US.</li><br />
<li>Building a tool to explore how climate change is likely to impact habitats, and thus the fish, fisheries, and communities that depend upon them.  The tool will integrate several streams of research to inform comprehensive marine planning in the region.</li>  <br />
<li>Working with the <a href="http://des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/wmb/coastal/" target="_blank">New Hampshire Coastal Program</a> to support a <a href="http://www.csc.noaa.gov/cms/fellows/pdfs/NH_2013.pdf" target="_blank">NOAA Coastal Management Fellow</a> who will use NatCap approaches and tools to conduct tradeoff analyses and inform priority restoration and management issues in New Hampshire's Great Bay Estuary.  The Fellow will focus on issues surrounding oyster restoration and aquaculture, eelgrass restoration, and diadromous fish restoration.</li> <br />
<li>Listening and learning in the region in the hopes of being able to ultimately provide science capacity and replicable, user-friendly approaches and tools to the <a href="http://northeastoceancouncil.org/regional-planning-body/" target="_blank">Northeast Regional Planning Body</a>, <a href="http://northeastoceancouncil.org/" target="_blank">NROC</a> and other decision-makers in the region as they envision comprehensive, ecosystem-based regional plans.</li>
<br />
<li>Building a tailored, easy to use tool for marine planning, with InVEST as its analytical core.  We are building this tool based on our experience working in New England, British Columbia and elsewhere and will be conducting workshops to ensure that we listen to the needs of our intended users as we develop it.  The tool will be tested in New England and we will ultimately train local analysts to use the tool.</li>
