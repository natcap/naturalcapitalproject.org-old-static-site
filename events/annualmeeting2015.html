<h1>2015 Natural Capital Symposium</h1>
<br />
<h2 style="text-align:center;">March 23-25, 2015</h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Stanford University</h2>
<p>This meeting will gather people from around the world who are working to factor the true value of nature into human decision-making. A variety of workshops, talks, discussions, and other sessions will be held in three primary tracks each day of this three-day symposium. In the "Training" track at the Symposium, attendees can learn about NatCap's approach and how to use our open-source tools in hands-on sessions with trainers.  In the "Pathways to Impact" and "Learning Exchange" tracks, we hope to foster dialogue, encourage collaboration, and learn from one another as a community.  In this spirit, we are inviting proposals for sessions to take place in the "Pathways to Impact" and "Learning Exchange" tracks at the Symposium:</p>
<h3 style="margin-left:15px;"><a href="#posters">Poster Session</a></h3>
<h3 style="margin-left:15px;"><a href="#panels">Panel Participation</a></h3>
<p><strong>Proposal Deadlines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Poster Session:</strong> check appropriate box during registration and submit poster proposal by 15 February 2015*</p>
<p><strong>Individual Contributions:</strong> proposals must be submitted by 15 February 2015*</p>
<p><em>*Proposals will be considered on a rolling basis, and spots are limited, so participants are encouraged to submit abstracts as soon as they are ready, before the deadline.</em></p>
<h2>About the Symposium</h2>
<p>The science and tools portion of The Natural Capital Symposium will be a 3-day course in NatCap's approach and our primary software tool, InVEST, for those who have limited or no prior experience with our approach and tools. There will also be more advanced technical training sessions offered each day for experienced users, focusing on hands-on work with specific models, the latest updates and advancements with the software, and other topics.</p>
<p>In our sessions on Pathways to Impact, experts from around the world will share experiences in using InVEST and related tools and approaches to drive change in policy and practice.  We will compare theories of change with actual experience of change in contrasting sites, sectors and decision contexts.  In sessions on Integrating Natural Capital and Resilience, we will discuss recent advances, emerging trends, and key challenges. NatCap strives to advance the science behind ecosystem services, and to apply new ways to bring our approach to governments, corporations, and other organizations across the globe. Sharing lessons and opportunities among members of the broader practitioner community is a great way to do that.</p>
<p>We will also be running a "learning exchange" throughout the Symposium. We know that we have a lot to learn from others working in this space, and we hope to foster a lively exchange of knowledge, information, and understanding.  The NatCap Learning Exchange will offer a variety of opportunities to work in small focus groups with NatCappers as well as practitioners from other organizations, including model-specific small-group workshops, poster sessions, focused discussion groups, panel discussions, and more. This will be a great opportunity to seek out new collaborations with NatCap and many other organizations and individuals who will also be in attendance.</p>
<p>We will be updating this page with more detailed information in the coming weeks. In the meantime, please contact <a href="mailto:borrebach@stanford.edu">Henry Borrebach</a> with any questions.</p>
<h2 id="LeX">Learning Exchange</h2>
<p>The <em>Learning Exchange</em> offers the opportunity to interact with NatCap staff as well as practitioners from other organizations, including model-specific small-group workshops, poster sessions, focused discussion groups, and more. This will be a great opportunity to seek out new collaborations with NatCap and many other organizations and individuals who will also be in attendance. During the Learning Exchange, there will be multiple opportunities to discuss your work with our staff, as well as representatives from our partner organizations. Sign-up sheets will be available during registration to participate in "sandbox sessions" during which participants will have the opportunity to discuss specific models and bring their own questions for NatCap researchers, analysts, and software engineers. We are also seeking suggestions for additional sessions within this track on other software modeling tools.</p>
