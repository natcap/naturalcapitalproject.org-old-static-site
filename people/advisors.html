		  <p> Ehrlich is a pioneering entomologist and author who is most widely recognized for his work in alerting the public to the perils of overpopulation. At Stanford University, he has pursued long-term studies of the structure, dynamics and genetics of natural butterfly populations, and is co-founder with Peter Raven of the field of co-evolution. Ehrlich is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. His many awards include a MacArthur Prize, the Crafoord Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (given in lieu of a Nobel Prize in areas where the Nobel is not given), the United Nations&rsquo; Sasakawa Environment Prize, and the Blue Planet Prize. </p>
