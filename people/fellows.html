<h2>Program Description</h2>
  <div class="photo_right"> <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EITbY5o0xyQ/TEngSREfZjI/AAAAAAAAB1Y/fbYOdnOb_ys/s720/2010_07_13_0195-1.jpg" alt="NatCap Folks" width="300" /> </div>
<p>The Natural Capital Project Fellows program is designed for senior researchers interested in pursuing research interests that align with the mission and programs of the Natural Capital Project. This highly-selective program provides mid-career researchers and professionals with the opportunity to work along side NatCap scientists for a few months. The Fellowship is designed to provide a self-directed and mutually beneficial learning environment, we hope to learn as much from you and your research as you do from us. It is intended for researchers who have an existing project to work on and a position to which they will return following this fellowship.<a href="../note">*</a> 
 </p>

<p>Fellows accepted into the program will have a primary liaison from the NatCap's research staff, who will coordinate their work and foster mutual learning with other researchers and the broader NatCap team. Most Fellows work with NatCap at our main office at Stanford University, where they can attend regular NatCap meetings and talks, and have access to the Stanford University community and events. Towards the end of their fellowship, they will have the opportunity to give a seminar on their work and present it to the NatCap research community. </p>
