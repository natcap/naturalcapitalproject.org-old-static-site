<p>short exciting bio info here, and info abt symposium</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Your panel at the symposium is called "Pathways to Impact," what does that mean to you?</h3>
<br/>
<p>"What is your pathway to impact?" It's a phrase funders like to use, and it seems to suggest a linear process - that you start here and end with impact. All of us know that isn't true [EDIT: That the process of change is not that linear]. We're still figuring out what those pathways are.</p><br/>
<p>This panel will be a way to explore in greater depth, the particular nuances and experiences we are all having along these pathway to impact, and share some of our frustrations.</p>
<br/>
<h3>What ground will you cover in your session?</h3>
<br/>
<p>The plan for the symposium session is to try and reflect a little bit on the last 3 or 4 years of work we've been doing in South Africa, across a range of areas and scales. {edit - Put China info here too]</p>
<br/>
<p>I'm trying to reconnect people to their environment. Each of the studies and projects we're working on is quite different,</p><br/>
<p>It's connecting decision- makers from the private sector to local, to national scale, across domains, from water, to food to disaster risk.</p><br/>
<p>We're trying to help them learn and work with us as we learn as well around ... to the enviornment. It usually comes through this idea of natural capital and ecosystem services</p><br/>
<p>Our idea for the session at the symposium is to present from diverse studies and try to draw from that, lessons that we are learning around from dec makers, the kidns of ---reconnecting to the env. and brinignt the environment to the decision-making.</p><br/>
<p>maintsteraming the envi, and integerating the environment.</p><br/>
<p>Human wellbeing?</p><br/>
<p>In south Africa --thers's such diversity</p><br/>
<p>we have fairly small projects, communities in communal areas, grazing capital, impacts of various changes in the landscape them, land cover change,</p><br/>
<p>The infestations of these big non-native woody trees that are moving into these areas. The trees are mostly Australian acacias - we call them black wattle. They were introduced mostly for timber and plantation forestry and have spread enormously.</p><br/>
<p>We have these government programs that are trying to give land back to these communities, as part of the redistribution following the process of democratization in South Africa. These big lands have been given back, but the land is covered with these non-native trees.</p><br/>
<p>We're working on [identifying] where these trees are limiting grazing capacity, where it's not really good land any more, not really viable. And [in some areas] we're working to clear the trees.</p><br/>
<p>They're also water-use intensive. So, we work with the Working for Water program, which hires unemployed people to clear these trees.We've seen these job creation programs ==and several students -- elements of land redistirubtion program. to be able to quantify, and present to these govt programs about where they need to redirect their efforts.</p><br/>
<p>So that's one end of the spectrum where we're working, in the rural communal land system arena. We're also working in the very wealthy end of the system. Along the southern Cape coast, many wealthy South Africans have holiday homes. They've also seen a wide variety of natural disasters, have been inundated with floods and wildfires in that part of the world. This raised a big flag for national insurance company, and that's at hte other end of hte spectrum, 2nd homes, wealthy, primarily flagging a concern that has a lot to do with how we'er looking after the land.</p><br/>
