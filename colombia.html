Through an analysis of mining permits in northern Colombia, this report presents a general framework to include ecosystem services in mitigation schemes for activities in all natural resource sectors.

<h1>Colombia</h1>
<div class="photo_right"><a href="images/Colombia_page_map.jpg" target="_blank"><p style="margin-left:10px"><img src="images/Colombia_page_map.jpg" alt="updated water funds map" width="225" height="252" border="2px"/></a></p> </div>
<p>NatCap and partners are using <a href="InVEST.html" target="_blank">InVEST</a> tools in several regions of Colombia to inform the siting of new development projects, to design a standard framework for impact assessment and environmental mitigation schemes, and to direct investment in conservation activities using quantified information on ecosystem services.</p>
<p> In the Cesar Department (<a href="images/Colombia_page_map.jpg" target="_blank">map</a>,1), InVEST outputs are informing the design of a mitigation framework that includes ecosystem services for the Ministry of the Environment. In the Putumayo Department (3), where the regional environmental authority is experimenting with compensatory mechanisms for ecosystem service loss, NatCap and WWF are applying InVEST to analyze services such as water supply and erosion control, and to compare their change under possible climate scenarios. NatCap's approach to identifying key services and priority conservartion areas is also being used in the East Cauca Valley (2) to guide the allocation of investments in watershed services.</p>
<a name="Mitigation" id="Mitigation"></a><br />
<h2>Including Ecosystem Services in Mitigation</h2>
<p>The Colombian national government has taken ambitious steps to protect natural environments, requiring development actions to mitigate and compensate negative environmental impacts to people and ecosystems. (<a href ="http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=16316" target="_blank">Decree 1220</a>, 2005) To aid the fulfillment of this requirement, scientists at NatCap and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) collaborated to design and operationalize a general mitigation framework that includes ecosystem services and their value to people.</p>
<p> In a report to the Colombian Ministry of the Environment, we demonstrate an application of our mitigation framework by evaluating impacts of new and proposed coal mine permits on drinking water quality regulation services in the Cesar Department. <a href ="models/models.html">InVEST models </a> were used to evaluate the potential to mitigate impact to communities through protection or restoration. Analyses suggest areas where mitigation is likely to offset the impacts of mine expansion, and for which mines full mitigation is not possible. This initial analysis is being adapted into a general decision-support tool for the Ministry's use in evaluating biodiversity and ecosystem service impacts of permitting projects with a standard approach.</p>

<h2>Climate Adaptation and Ecosystem Services</h2>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/Putumayo_Basin__Colombia_pic.jpg" alt="Putumayo Study Site" /></div>

<p>In the Upper Putumayo basin of Colombia's Sibundoy Valley, NatCap partners at World Wildlife Fund (WWF) work with the regional environmental regulatory agency, <a href= "http://www.corpoamazonia.gov.co/" target="_blank"> Corpoamazonía</a>, and the  Foundation Center for Sustainable Agricultural Systems (<a href = "http://www.cipav.org.co/" target="_blank">CIPAV </a>), a nonprofit research organization, to analyze key ecosystem services and inform long-term conservation schemes and climate adaptation plans.</p>
<p>To understand the impacts of emerging development on ecosystem services and the expected intensification of these effects under climate change, NatCap's InVEST models were used to:
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
<b>Quantify the provision of regionally important ecosystem services</b> including water yield, capacity for <a href= "models/carbon.html"target="_blank">carbon sequestration</a>, <a href= "models/water_purification.html" target="_blank">nutrient retention</a> and <a href= "models/sediment_retention.html"target="_blank">erosion control</a>;</li>
<li style="margin=bottom: 10px;">
<b>Analyze the change in water supply and erosion control</b> under two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios of altered temperature and precipitation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Scientists identified areas with the highest concentration of ecosystem services, the greatest risk of services loss from incompatible activities, or the greatest potential to increase services with conservation measures. Select locations are being integrated into a compensation and rewards for ecosystem services (CRES) scheme, a method of contracting payment among beneficiaries and stewards of ecosystems, used to enhance service provisioning or mitigate degradation. WWF Colombia and partners have also selected pilot locations for silvopastoral systems, in which trees are planted along water bodies to enhance erosion control and water quality regulation.</p>

<h2>Directing Water Fund Investments in the Cauca Valley</h2>
<div class="photo_left"><img src="images/FAVS_logo.jpg" alt="Putumayo Study Site" width="140" height="99" /></div>
<p>NatCap works with TNC, Asocaña (an association of sugar cane producers), CVC (the local environmental authority) and local watershed associations in supporting the operation of a <a href = "waterfunds.html" target="_blank">water fund</a> in Colombia's East Cauca Valley. Founded in 2009, the Fondo de Agua por la Vida y la Sostenibilidad (FAVS), or Water Fund for Life and Sustainability, aims to secure biodiversity and water-related service benefits including sediment retention and maintenance of regular water flows. </p>
<p>To direct FAVS' investments to areas with high potential for positive socioeconomic and environmental impact, NatCap developed new ecosystem service ranking models to compare the returns of investment in various conservation activities. Tests of this <a href = "RIOS.html" target="_blank">multi-objective maximization approach</a> resulted in observed changes in ecosystem services up to six times greater than previous ad-hoc investments. 
<br /> <br />The fund currently supports watershed protection activities, environmental education programs, forest enrichment and restoration, and improved farming practices. These activities are securing water services for over a million residents downstream, conserving at least 125,000 ha of natural ecosystems, and benefiting sugar cane production, a key industry in Colombia. </p> <br />

<h2>Preliminary Results</h2>
<br />
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Developed and tested method to standardize water fund investments:</b> Our approach to optimizing water fund investments in the East Cauca Valley laid the foundation for developing <a href="RIOS.html" target="_blank">RIOS</a> (Resource Investment Optimization System), released in summer 2013. RIOS is a software tool combining biophysical, social and economic data to maximize the returns of conservation investments. <a href ="images/RIOS_approach_CaucaValley.jpg" target="_blank">Click here</a> to view a schematic of the RIOS approach as applied in the Cauca Valley.</li>


<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Creating specialized decision-support tool for environmental mitigation </b> that includes ecosystem services, for the Colombian Ministry of the Environment. We plan to build upon this work and create a tool that can be used in environmental impact assessments and mitigation efforts anywhere.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Supporting collaborative stakeholder engagement process </b> in the Putumayo Basin known as <i>conversatorios</i>, to act as a vehicle for stakeholders to influence development and land management decisions. WWF Colombia is sharing InVEST results with conversatorios participants and fostering dialogue about which - and where - adaptive measures can enhance critical ecosystem services in the Putumayo region. </li>
