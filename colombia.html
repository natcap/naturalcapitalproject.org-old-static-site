<h2>Ecosystem Services</h2>
<ul>
<b>Drinking Water</b>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Watersheds are critical to providing safe water to urban centers. Improved land-use practices reduce erosion and nutrient pollution, cleaning water supplies for those downstream. Beyond what flows from the tap, clean water arriving at cities is also used to make bottled drinks such as sodas and beer.</li>
<b>Flood Protection</b>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Water fund investments in natural capital can slow overland flow of water and increase travel time of water to the river, decreasing the peak magnitude of floods. Reducing peak flow can reduce damage to infrastructure and private property, and reduce risk to human life. </li>
<b>Hydropower</b>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Erosion control that keeps sediment out of waterways can also keep sediment from settling in reservoirs where it can reduce the production capacity of hydropower facilities, shorten the lifetime of the reservoir, or increase dredge costs.</li> 
<b>Poverty Alleviation</b>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Some water funds also have social objectives, in addition to biophysical goals of securing water supplies. For example, the World Bank has assessed the potential to use payments from water funds as a means to alleviate rural poverty in Guatemala.</li>

<p>The Natural Capital project supports water funds across Latin America to represent the interests of multiple stakeholders and maximize the water-related benefits of improved land management. Water Funds gather contributions from water users to finance conservation and to help secure water quality and quantity.</p>
<p>Our work in Latin America aims to create a scientifically rigorous, yet flexible return on investment approach to guide water fund design and fund investments. Based on the lessons and best practices from across the region, we are developing a standardized, scientific approach to managing water fund investments that is applicable in any location.</p>

<h2>Water Fund Investments in Latin America</h2>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/cc/WF-map.jpg" alt="Water Funds Map" /></div>
<p>The Natural Capital Project is working with the Latin America Water Funds Platform (a partnership among The Nature Conservancy, the Inter-American Development Bank, Global Environment Facility and the FEMSA Foundation) to develop a science-based software tool that will standardize water fund investment design.  Water is one of the scarcest resources on the planet, and pressures on it will only grow as the human population expands and climate changes. Latin America is making a major effort to address this issue through development of a new conservation financing mechanism known as water funds. The goal of these funds is to improve the management of watersheds, the green infrastructure that supplies, regulates, and cleans water.</p>
<p>Water funds are a finance mechanism for watershed conservation and provision of clean, ample water. Beneficiaries of a watershed make financial contributions to a fund that is used to promote conservation activities including protection, restoration, and best management practices in crop and pasture lands. Water funds work when these activities supply water, and provide purification and regulation services at lower costs than other forms of treatment and flow regulation such as dams and water treatment plants.</p>
<p>In 2011 the Latin American Water Funds Partnership committed to developing 32 new water funds in Latin America over 5 years, pledging $27 million to restore over 7 million acres of watersheds (see map above). The Natural Capital project is working with this partnership to develop water funds that represent the interests of multiple stakeholders and maximize the water-related benefits of improved land management. Our work builds on the experiences of existing water funds to develop a standardized and flexible approach to water fund design and investment.  Our approach values the environmental returns on watershed investments through hydrological models while accounting for preferences and requirements of stakeholders.  Our work in the Cauca Valley of Columbia has improved the return on investment in their water fund (early results indicate this may be as high as a five-fold increase), as watershed conservation efforts are now able to choose the conservation activities and areas for investment to yield the greatest improvements to water quality. </p>

<h2>Early Testbeds of Science-based Investing</h2>
<p>Water fund projects have proliferated in NASCA thanks to TNC leadership and innovation. Water funds essentially use a sustainable finance mechanism for watershed conservation. Water users make voluntary financial contributions into a fund that is invested, providing a long term revenue source for conservation of the watershed. Contributors are motivated by the fact that watershed conservation will provide water purification and regulation services at lower cost than other forms of treatment and flow regulation such as through built
infrastructure.</p>
<p>In order to value water services from the watershed, identify priority sites for investment in the watersheds to secure those services, and set up monitoring programs (identification of priority sites for monitoring) for these water funds, feasibility and design studies were developed and run with technical support from NASCA
Science and Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (<a href="http://www.ciat.cgiar.org/">CIAT</a>).</p>
<p><a href="InVEST.html">InVEST</a>, SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), and FIESTA (Fog Interception for the
Enhancement of Stream flow in Tropical Areas) models were run using data from the watershed in the East Cauca Valley in Colombia, the site of a recent water fund project. Model results have helped determine critical areas in the watershed for immediate water fund investments. In addition, comparison of model results is helping to inform the use of InVEST for water fund projects throughout the region.

<h2>RIOS: Resource Investment Optimization System</h2>
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/cc/RIOS-IP.jpg" alt="Investment portfolio" /></div>
<p>RIOS is a water funds development tool co-designed with users to improve returns from conservation investments based on a combination of biophysical, social and economic data. The tool has been tested in several emerging water funds across Latin America and has proven useful for managers and flexible enough to apply in different environmental, social, and legal contexts.  RIOS is free and designed for companies, consultants, government agencies or non-government organizations to use in the development of water fund investments. It provides decision makers with the best locations on a landscape to spend funds to maximize the ecological return on investment, within the bounds of what is socially and politically feasible.  Additionally, RIOS quantifies returns for some of the most desired water benefits including erosion control, water purification, and flood mitigation.  Our goal for RIOS is to provide a standardized approach to water fund design and investment prioritization in contexts throughout the world.</p>

<p>RIOS's first public release is scheduled for Spring of 2013 but it is available on our website now as a <a href="rios_download.html">prototype in development</a>.</p>

<h2>Preliminary Results</h2>
<br />
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Landmark commitment to water funds:</b> In 2011 the Latin American Water Funds Partnership committed to implementing and capitalizing 32 new water funds over 5 years, pledging  $27 million to restore over 7 million acres of watersheds. NatCap is improving conservation returns for several of these funds.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Developing RIOS (Resource Investment Optimization System) software tool</b>, to standardize water funds investment design and optimize the feasibility and ecosystems returns of conservation activities.  The tool is being designed by a team of scientists, practitioners and managers through an iterative, field-tested approach. RIOS is in the final stage of development and will be released to the public in 2013.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Built Capacity across Water Funds</b>, and hosted trainings for data analysts throughout Latin America. Provided scientific counsel to high-level managers and project implementers.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Optimizing returns on investments.</b> In its final form, RIOS will compare returns on investment for a RIOS-designed portfolio to returns from a more ad-hoc investment approach, giving a sense of how much the science improves investment returns.</li>
