		<p>&ldquo;Nine watersheds tumble into Cauca Valley, a region in the southwest of Colombia sandwiched between two of the Colombia Andean mountain chains. For centuries, its richness has attracted humans, who exploited the valley's resources first for agriculture and stockbreeding, and later for hydroelectric power generation. Today, sugar cane production dominates the valley's industry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'There are many stresses from water use. The sugar cane sector is thirsty, but the people who live there also need it for daily activities and for drinking water,' says Alejandro Calvache, a water fund specialist at The Nature Conservancy, based in Cartagena, Columbia. TNC, in collaboration with the sugar cane growers' association, the regional environmental authority and several grassroots organizations, is building a water fund that will oversee a massive program of reforestation, water protection, soil improvements, education and training. By investing in the region's ecosystem services, the project, which is called 'Agua Por La Vida y la Sostenibilidad' — meaning 'Water for Life and sustainability' — aims to lessen climate change impacts and threats to biodiversity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Water funds exist globally to conserve watersheds, but this is one of the first to include climate change modelling to help direct investments. The International Center for Tropical Agriculture, a research institute in Columbia, is modelling scenarios to determine the effects of climate change on local water resources. These scenarios are then fed into a computer-based decision-making tool called InVEST, which has been developed by the Natural Capital Project, a partnership between TNC, Stanford University and the World Wildlife Fund. InVEST identifies the areas where climate change is unlikely to threaten activities the water fund has been invested in — such as promoting the reforestation of a hillside or teaching eco-friendly cattle-ranching practices — and their returns. 'Traditionally, conservation has pulled on people's heart-strings,' says Heather Tallis, lead scientist at Natural Capital. 'We try to appeal to people's lifeblood, like drinking water.'&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Just documenting diversity doesn’t guarantee that a place becomes a park. Selecting good bits requires understanding how critters use space and weighing competing claims for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One recent approach looks to double the punch of the case for setting aside land by identifying biodiverse places that also provide documented ecosystem services, says Taylor Ricketts, who heads the World Wildlife Fund’s Conservation Science Program, based in Washington, D.C. Though the two don’t match tidily, Ricketts has found a few natural sweet spots important for their variety of living things and for such boons as storing abundant carbon or collecting water.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The challenge of determining, measuring, and communicating the values of ecosystem services is being addressed through efforts such as the Natural Capital Project...to develop tools for facilitating incorporation of natural capital (i.e., valuation of ecosystem services) into decision making. Their first tool, InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs), can model and map the delivery, distribution, and economic value of ecosystem services into the future. InVEST allows users to visualize the impacts of their potential decisions, which enables identification of tradeoffs among environmental, economic, and social benefits. This tool has already been applied successfully using stakeholder defined scenarios to predict changes in land use and associated tradeoffs in the Willamette Valley, Oregon (Nelson et al., 2009). Although InVEST was initially focused on terrestrial ecosystems, it is now being applied to coastal and marine ecosystems to provide maps and projections of ecosystem services under different management alternatives for issues, such as tradeoffs associated with large-scale implementation of desalination plants in California (Ruckelshaus and Guerry, 2009). Marine InVEST
offers a promising new approach for incorporating scientific information about ecosystem services into decision making and resource management.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The overall lesson is that what looks beneficial only does so because the profits are retained by the private sector, while the problems are spread out across society at large, appearing on no specific balance sheet. Ecosystem-services researchers are now providing such balance sheets in more and more of the world. Poor countries such as South Africa and Tanzania have realised that if they study the provision of such services sensibly, they can make more rational decisions and avoid some of the costly mistakes made by those places that have already developed. To this end, the Natural Capital Project, a group based at Stanford University, California, has developed a suite of computer programs called InVEST, which will analyse and map ecosystem services. InVEST allows farmers, landowners and government officials to make better-informed decisions about the current and future costs of an activity.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We must translate our actions—and the intended or unintended results—into environmental values we can compare with other values, such as increased income or jobs. Economists have already made great progress in valuing certain environmental benefits. For example, we can infer the value of nature to homeowners by analyzing how housing prices increase with access to lakes, a scenic view or other environmental amenities. And, we must bring the values of nature to bear in our decision-making processes. Innovative public policies, such as incentive-based regulations, and private initiatives, such as environmental certification, harness market forces for environmental protection, showing it is possible to protect the environment—even in a rising economy.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;If nature were being protected for her own sake, there would be no worry. But around the world nature is being liquidated—at accelerating rates. Moreover, in rich and poor countries alike, conservation is often seen as the passion of a small minority, in conflict with most people's needs and aspirations. Changing this situation requires two things: first, shining a light on nature’s tremendous but often invisible values; and second, demonstrating how these values can be mainstreamed into resource decisions to benefit both people and nature.&rdquo;</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/article/09408" target="_blank"><i>Strategy + Business,</i> Winter 2009: November 24, 2009</a> (<a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/media/file/sb57_09408.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>)</p>
		<p>&ldquo;GRETCHEN DAILY: 'Since the dawn of humanity, people have been a small-time force on the planet. Except for matters of local scarcity, nature's life support systems were free and abundant. We never had to think about the dangers of running out of fertile soil, clean water, or pollinators (such as bees, birds, and bats) that made it possible to reap a harvest; an ozone layer to shield us from ultraviolet radiation; or forests to soak up precipitation and control flooding. Before the late 20th century, anyone living in Louisiana could take for granted that the barrier islands off the coast would help protect them from storms.</p>

<p>Today, that has changed. Shoreline ecosystems have been so eroded by development that many communities were more vulnerable to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and to the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. The world's population is close to 7 billion now, and many people in emerging countries hope to live like the Americans they see on television shows. They’re going to demand more protein, such as beef or chicken, in their diets, which will require a sixfold increase in the amount of grain consumed per capita. That would require much more arable land than we have on the planet, even if we cut down all the remaining natural forests. And if we did do that, the increase in greenhouse gases would make the risks of climate change far worse.</p>

<p>In other words, humanity is rapidly liquidating its own long-term life support systems. And we've only just begun to pay the price. Anywhere you look, there is suddenly a zero-sum game when it comes to land, water, or other key natural resources. We can't afford to go on treating nature like an all-you-can-eat buffet. We need to recognize that there are a ton of people sitting around this one little table, and we’ve got to establish both prices and table manners to sustain the bounty.'&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Economists have been working on attaching monetary value to components of natural systems since at least the 1960s, evaluating the cost of damage caused by oil spills, for example. But environmental activists and conservationists didn't pay this work much attention. Many felt that nature should be saved not for it price, but for its own sake...Daily focuses much of her energy on the Natural Capital Project, a joint effort she brokered between Stanford, the conservation group WWF and the Nature Conservancy. The project, which she co-directs, is developing a software system to help people weigh up the value of land in terms of ecosystem services, alongside its value for building houses or other development. Maps of an area are layered with information — much of which can be displayed in dollars — such as which parts of the landscape are best for filtering water, where the real-estate is most valuable, where the most carbon can be stored and where the biodiversity is highest. Such maps could help governmental organizations evaluate, for example, the cost of building on land that provides free water filtration if the development would then require the construction of a costly water plant. 'We can bring about this transformation if we supply tools that make it easy for decision-makers to compare alternative scenarios,' she says.&rdquo;</p>

Nature not only provides us food, water, fuel and fiber; it also helps to prevent soil erosion and floods...When we destroy natural ecosystems, we lose these assets and the services they provide to us.

		<p>&ldquo;Beijing's strategy for clean water during the Olympics? Pay rural farmers to 'grow' it. Katherine Ellison explores China's new hope for conserving the precious natural resources it has left. Last September...several Chinese government-affiliated scientists met with a team from the Natural Capital Project - a year-old partnership between Stanford University, The Nature Conservancy and WWF. The project has developed mapping and modeling software to pinpoint landscapes where conservation makes the most sense, a tool that has great potential to help the Chinese government fine-tune its concept of preserving 'ecological function zones.'&rdquo;</p>

Conservationists would then work with local governments, industry and the financial markets to set up incentives encouraging measures for the protection of ecosystems and the vital services they provide.&rdquo;</p>
