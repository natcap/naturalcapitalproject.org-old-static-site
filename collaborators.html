  <p> Armsworth&rsquo;s research focuses on the interface of ecology and economics and specifically on the design of investments in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. He also studies spatial population and community dynamics in both terrestrial and marine systems. He was a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford. He is a theoretical ecologist and holds two Ph.D.s, one in mathematics and one in biology. </p>

  <div class="photo_right"> <img src="images/bios/kai_chan.jpg" alt="Kai Chan" height="140" /> </div>
  <p> Chan is a transdisciplinary scholar of biodiversity conservation and associated human needs and responsibilities. A frequent contributor to popular media, he also collaborates with The Nature Conservancy, Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, and other conservation organizations with the aim of integrating science into conservation planning and action. He has won awards from the Heinz Foundation, the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies, and many others. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University after receiving his Ph.D. from Princeton University. </p>

  <div class="photo_right"> <img src="images/bios/claire_kremen.jpg" alt="Claire Kremen" height="140" width="118" /> </div>
  <p>Kremen's primary interest is to use biological, social, and economic data to develop conservation plans that benefit both the environment and people, and her work has included a wide array of topics, from the economics and ecology of ecosystem services, to reserve design and ecological monitoring. She was recently awarded a MacArthur Fellowship for her contributions to ecology, agriculture, and biodiversity. Her work reaches from theory to practice and includes hands-on conservation action, including design and establishment of one of  Madagascar's largest national parks. Her current research focuses on restoring pollination services within farming landscapes, using both predictive modeling and field studies. She was a member of the recent National Academy of Sciences study on the status of pollinators in North America. In Madagascar, she works to establish a national web-based conservation-planning tool by accumulating data on species occurrences, developing predictive models of species distributions, conducting conservation analyses, and making data and analyses accessible via the Internet.</p>

  </p>
  <div class="photo_right"> <img src="images/bios/eric_lonsdorf.jpg" alt="Eric Lonsdorf" height="140" /> </div>
  <p> Lonsdorf has specialized in the study of fragmented prairie plant communities, conservation of genetic diversity in foundation species, conservation of chimpanzee populations in Tanzania, and management of jaguars in Argentina. Beyond his academic research, he has also advised the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service on how to incorporate adaptive decision-making into the management of their National Wildlife Refuge system. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota's Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior department and his B.A. from Carleton College.

  </p>
  <div class="photo_right"> <img src="images/bios/robin_naidoo.jpg" alt="Robin Naidoo" height="140" /> </div>
  <p> Naidoo&rsquo;s interests focus on integrating economic costs and benefits into ecoregion planning and conservation. He has mapped the economic costs and ecosystem values of conservation at both the landscape scale, including sites in Uganda and Paraguay, and at the global scale. Naidoo received his Ph.D from the University of Alberta with the co-supervision of professors in the Biology and Rural Economy departments. His work has been published in peer-reviewed journals in both economics and ecology. </p>

  </p>
  <div class="photo_right"> <img src="images/bios/erik_nelson.jpg" alt="Erik Nelson" height="140" /> </div>
  <p> Nelson is working with the Natural Capital Project to develop a set of tools for mapping and modeling ecosystem service values across the landscape. Nelson is particularly interested in determining how sensitive valuation calculations are to choice of mapping scale, availability of data, and model parameter uncertainty. Nelson received his Ph.D. from the Department of Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota with a concentration in Environmental Economics and a minor in Conservation Biology. </p>
