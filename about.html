<h1>About The Natural Capital Project</h1>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/about_01.jpg" alt="© Neil Burgess" height="180" width="220" /></div>
<p>Our partnership is a joint venture among <a href="http://woods.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford
University's Woods Institute for the Environment</a>, <a href="http://environment.umn.edu/" target="_blank">
University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.org" target="_blank">The
Nature Conservancy</a>, and <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org" target="_blank">World
Wildlife Fund.</a> </p>
<p>In addition to our four core partners, we work closely with experts across Stanford and Minnesota's
campuses and from many institutions in the public, private and
non-profit sectors.</p>
<p>In short, we engage
leaders in key institutions and meld world-class research and development with
influential, on-the-ground conservation programs.</p>
<br />
<h2>Developing tools that make it easy to incorporate natural
capital into decisions</h2>
<br />
<p>We are developing tools for quantifying the values of natural
capital in clear, credible, and practical ways. In promising a return
(of societal benefits) on investments in nature, the scientific
community needs to deliver knowledge and tools to quantify and forecast
this return. </p>
<p>To meet this need, we are developing InVEST, a family of
software-based tools for Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and
Tradeoffs. InVEST enables decision-makers to quantify the importance of
natural capital, to assess the tradeoffs associated with alternative
choices, and to integrate conservation and human development.</p>
<p>The National Center for Ecological Assessment and Synthesis (<a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">NCEAS</a>)
has been an integral collaborator in the early development and
application of InVEST, helping to make it a highly flexible and
publicly available tool.</p>

<br />
<h2>Demonstrating the power of these tools in important,
contrasting places</h2>
<br />
<p>With many partners around the world, we are using these tools
to integrate scientific and economic understanding of natural assets
into real land-use and investment decisions.</p>
<p>We are focused on national and state governments &#8211; and working
with key policy makers, resource managers, scientists, and other
diverse leaders in a suite of important and contrasting "demonstration
projects." Our principal engagements are in Canada, China, Colombia,
Ecuador, Indonesia, Tanzania, and the United States (California,
Hawai'i, Oregon, and Washington states).</p>

<h2>Advancing natural capital approaches by engaging leaders in
key institutions</h2>
<br />
<p>Our demonstration projects are designed for replication and
scaling. Through these projects, and by engaging leaders in key
institutions, we are advancing the use of natural capital approaches
worldwide. We seek a global, deep, and game-changing transformation in
how governments and businesses factor the values of nature into policy
and decision-making.</p>

<br />
<h2>From theory to practice</h2>
<p>We have made rapid progress since our inception in November
2006 toward our first two goals (developing tools and demonstration
projects). While significant work remains to achieve these, we have now
moved beyond the start-up phase and are planning to take on exciting
challenges in magnifying our impact.</p>
