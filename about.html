<h1>About The Natural Capital Project</h1>
<br />
<div class="photo_right"><img src="images/NatCap-Logo.jpg" alt="Natural Capital Project Logo"/></div>

<p><b>The vision</b> of the Natural Capital Project is a world in which people, governments, and corporations recognize the values of natural capital – embodied in Earth's lands, waters and biodiversity – in supporting human well-being, and routinely incorporate these values into decision-making.</p>  

<p>We are advancing three strategies to achieve this vision:  creating innovative, practical tools; testing and implementing these in major policy decisions, in sites and sectors globally; and engaging leaders to magnify the impact of models of success.<p>
<br />

<h2>Developing tools that make it easy to incorporate natural
capital into decisions</h2>
<br />

<p>We are developing tools for quantifying the values of natural capital in clear, credible, and practical ways. In promising a return (of societal benefits) on investments in nature, the scientific community needs to deliver knowledge and tools to quantify and forecast this return. </p>
<p>To meet this need, we are developing InVEST, a family of software-based tools for Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs. InVEST enables decision-makers to quantify the importance of natural capital, to visualize the benefits delivered today and in the future, to assess the tradeoffs associated with alternative choices, and to integrate conservation and human development.</p>

<br />
<h2>Demonstrating the power of these tools in important,
contrasting places</h2>
<br />
<p>With many partners around the world, we are using these tools to integrate natural capital values into major resource policies and decisions.  These demonstration projects range from:</p>
<ul>

          <li style="margin-bottom:5px">helping to implement China's new system of reserves spanning 24% of the country, aimed at securing both natural capital and human well-being; to</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:5px">working with indigenous communities in strategic planning of land and ocean resource uses so as to balance conflicting values; to</li>
	      <li style="margin-bottom:5px">working with corporations to quantify the risks and opportunities of alternative resource development options.</li>
        </ul>
          
<p>Our principal engagements are in Belize, Canada, China, Colombia, Ecuador (and now across Latin America), Indonesia, Tanzania, Uganda, and the United States.</p>

<h2>Advancing natural capital approaches by engaging leaders in
key institutions</h2>
<br />
<p>Our demonstration projects are designed for replication and scaling. Through these projects, and by engaging leaders in key institutions, we are advancing the use of natural capital approaches worldwide. We seek a global, deep, and game-changing transformation in how governments and businesses factor the values of nature into policy and decision-making.</p>

<br />

<h2>From theory to practice</h2>
<p>We have made rapid progress since our inception in November 2006 toward our first two goals (developing tools and demonstration projects). While significant work remains to achieve these, we have now moved beyond the start-up phase and are planning to take on exciting challenges in magnifying our impact.</p>
