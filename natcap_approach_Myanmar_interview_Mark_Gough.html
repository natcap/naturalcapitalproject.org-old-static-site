<div style="text-align:center"><h1>How The Natural Capital Approach Is <br/>Being Used In Myanmar</h1>
<br/>

	<p>The sun rises above the horizon as a crimson ball, veiled by a haze of humidity that blankets the early morning landscape. Men in plaid longyis and women in wide-brimmed hats, their faces painted with creamy thanaka, make their way from thatched houses to tend rice paddies before the heat becomes oppressive. It's a timeless scene that has played out more or less this way for centuries in the fertile lowland plains of Myanmar.</p><br/>
	<p>The pastoral tranquility of the Bago countryside I was driving through stands in stark contrast to Naypyidaw, Myanmar's capital city, which was meticulously designed and constructed from scratch less than 10 years ago. There, with rice paddies still being tended on the outskirts of the city, the national government of Myanmar is embracing modernity with an emphasis on order and efficiency. Workers drive from designated residential zones to ministry offices along wide, manicured boulevards spanning eight, ten, and - in front of the Parliament Building - 22 lanes, which are mostly empty now, but point to a bustling vision for the future. Visitors like me are put up in sprawling hotels and meet in a spacious brick and glass conference center in the hotel zone.</p><br/>
	<p>The stark juxtaposition of old and new, tradition and modernity, reflects transformations happening throughout Myanmar as the country emerges from military rule and starts to establish a nominally civilian democracy following general elections in 2010.</p><br/>
	<p><strong>After a half-century of isolation, Myanmar still has what everyone around them used to have more of — abundant natural capital</strong> such as their expansive forests and free-flowing rivers. Myanmar also has a treasure of biodiversity, including endangered tigers and critically endangered Irrawaddy river dolphins. How Myanmar develops will determine whether their natural wealth is liquidated for short term gains, or protected and managed to sustain long-term benefit.</p><br/>
    <p>I traveled with a small group to Myanmar a few weeks ago for a series of meetings about natural capital assessments that WWF is conducting, and to attend the country's annual Green Economy Green Growth forum (GEGG, <a href="http://www.geggmyanmar.org/" target="_blank">geggmyanmar.org</a>). The forum convenes national and international experts to offer policy and technical input on sustainable development to the government and its ministries. In his opening remarks at the forum, the President of Myanmar, H.E. Thein Sein, cited climate change, population growth, and declining natural resources as the chief challenges for sustainable development, and asserted that resource-intensive growth is no longer a viable development strategy. He emphasized the imperative of using natural capital efficiently, and to "integrate environmental conservation into all development activities."</p><br/>
    <p>When WWF formally opened its office in Myanmar last year, WWF-US CEO Carter Roberts showed the President a series of maps from WWF's initial natural capital assessment of the Tanintharyi region. The maps, created using NatCap's InVEST software, highlighted the spatial distribution of carbon stocks, water yield, and coastal protection by mangroves and other natural habitats. The President, a trained geographer, immediately recognized the value of the assessment, and asked for a natural capital assessment of the entire country.  He said that he wants his country to develop in a way that raises people out of poverty without destroying natural capital, in keeping with his government's commitment to sustainable development.</p><br/>
    <p><strong>One example of these pivotal development choices is playing out right now in the Tanintharyi region</strong> where Myanmar and Thailand are pursuing a joint venture to link Bangkok to the port town of Dawei with an improved road and a new high-speed rail line to transport goods and promote trade.  The development corridor bisects one of the largest intact forests in Southeast Asia and is vitally important as tiger habitat.  How and where the road and rail are built will determine whether tiger habitat is fragmented or if ecological connectivity is preserved. WWF's hope is that the transportation infrastructure will incorporate tunnels and viaducts so that wildlife corridors are left intact.</p><br/>
    <p>To meet the country's demand for natural capital information, WWF Myanmar is developing staff capacity to apply the natural capital approach and, as part of that approach, to also train the government and other partners. As first steps, Nirmal Bhagabati, Adam Dixon and Nasser Olwero trained GIS and other staff from the Myanmar Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry (MOECAF) to use InVEST, and are now in discussions with them about how best to collaborate on refinement of the natural capital assessment of the Tanintharyi region and on the national scale assessment requested by the President. This work is being conducted under an MOU with MOECAF, and with funding from the Helmsley Foundation. By mapping where natural capital delivers valuable ecosystem services like carbon sequestration, water yield, and coastal protection; and by comparing how natural capital values change under different development scenarios; they aim to reveal tradeoffs and to inform pending development decisions in a way that will preserve Myanmar's natural capital.</p><br/>
    <p>WWF also led a half-day symposium on sustainable infrastructure at the GEGG forum, co-sponsored with Infra Eco Network Europe (IENE, <a href="http://www.iene.info/" target="_blank">iene.info</a>). Nat Cap's Lisa Mandle shared examples from Colombia and Peru of how natural capital approaches can be harnessed for sustainable road planning and development. She highlighted how infrastructure affects and is also dependent on natural capital, and emphasized the importance of taking natural capital into account early in the planning process to reduce costs and improve outcomes for the people of Myanmar and for nature.</p><br/>
    <p>Nirmal Bhagabati presented the initial assessment of natural capital in the Tanintharyi region. And three experts from IENE presented several case studies of road design and construction in Europe, and offered suggestions about ways to minimize the negative impacts of roads on wildlife and ecosystems by conducting environmental impact assessments and incorporating tunnels and bridges into road design in order to preserve safe wildlife passages and improve human safety.</p><br/>
    <p>Impressed by the natural capital expertise of our group, the Director General of the Environmental Conservation Department, Nay Aye, formally requested WWF's assistance in developing a national Green Economy Policy and Strategic Framework. The Minister of Environmental Conservation and Forestry, U Win Tun, formally announced our cooperation during his closing remarks at the GEGG forum.</p><br/>
    <p>In Myanmar today, there is an unprecedented and unparalleled opportunity to apply the natural capital approach and concepts about sustainable infrastructure to guide more sustainable development while conserving biodiversity.  Myanmar's neighbors largely exploited their natural capital while pursuing resource and carbon-intensive development during the latter half of the 20th century.  Myanmar essentially leap-frogged that era, and is initiating its economic development with its natural capital largely intact.  Myanmar also has the "latecomer advantage" of being able to learn from what others have done.  So far, they seem to be seizing on that advantage by embracing the natural capital concept.  Stay tuned in the coming months and years as WWF, the Natural Capital Project and others work with the government and other NGOs in Myanmar to apply the natural capital approach and realize their aspirations for "green growth."</p>
