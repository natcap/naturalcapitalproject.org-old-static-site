     <p><strong><a href="pubs/NewScientist_june2012.pdf">China Leads March for Green Economy</a></strong><br/>
New Scientist - by Sara Reardon - <em>June 16, 2012<p> Featuring Gretchen Daily and Peter Kareiva</em></p>
<p> When appeals to an environmental
conscience cannot motivate
governments to conserve their
natural resources, a swift kick in the
wallet may. That's the idea behind a
strategy expected to be discussed at the
Rio+20 United Nations Conference on
Sustainable Development next week.
Gaining traction are projects to
quantify the value of "services"
provided to us by oceans, forests and
other ecosystems, determine the
economic hit to a nation once they
run out, and then paying would-be
consumers to conserve those assets.
And, with characteristic pragmatism,
China is leading the experiment.</p>

Environmental Health Perspectives - by David C. Holtzman - <em>April, 2012. Featuring NatCap, InVEST, as well as Gretchen Daily, Peter Kareiva, Taylor Ricketts, and Emily McKenzie of the Natural Capital Project.</em></p>
<p> Healthy ecosystems provide us with fertile soil, clean water, timber, and food. They reduce the spread of diseases. The protect against flooding. World-wide, they regulate atmospheric concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide. They moderate climate. Without these and other "ecosystem services" we'd all perish.</p>

Greenwire - by Paul Voosen - <em>April 3, 2012</em><br/>
<em>Featuring Peter Kareiva, one of the founders and Directors of the Natural Capital Project</em></p>

<p>Peter Kareiva had come to answer for his truths.</p>

<p>Settling at the head of a long table ringed by young researchers new to the policy world, Kareiva, chief scientist of the Nature Conservancy, the world's largest environmental organization, cracked open a beer. After a long day mentoring at the group's headquarters, an eight-story box nestled in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, he was ready for some sparring.</p>

<p>The scientists had read Kareiva's recent essay, which takes environmentalists to task. The data couldn't bear out their piety, he wrote. Nature is often resilient, not fragile. There is no wilderness unspoiled by man. Thoreau was a townie. Conservation, by many measures, is failing. If it is to survive, it has to change.</p>

OnEarth - by Bruce Barcott - <em>March 21, 2012</em><br/>
<em>Featuring Mary Ruckelshaus, Managing Director of the Natural Capital Project</em></p>

<p>Environmental policy is something of a family business for Mary Ruckelshaus. Her father, the attorney William Ruckelshaus, became the first administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, when she was in fourth grade, and returned for a second term in the mid-1980s. "We had a lot of great dinner table discussions," she recalls, but her own interest was in science more than legal policy. A Ph.D. in biology led her to Seattle, where she worked on salmon and orca recovery for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In 2010 she became managing director of the Natural Capital Project, an environmental think tank based at Stanford University. Advancing ideas developed by co-founder Gretchen Daily in her groundbreaking books Nature's Services and <em>The New Economy of Nature</em>, the project's team of biologists, economists, data analysts, and legal scholars collaborates with governments and NGOs to fairly value ecosystem services</p>
