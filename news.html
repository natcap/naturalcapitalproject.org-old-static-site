Dot Earth - New York Times<em> December 19, 2012<p>by ANDREW C. REVKIN </p></em>
<p>A new analysis by dozens of scientists provides a useful update on measured and anticipated impacts of human-driven climate change on ecosystems from western forests to coastal waters. The report, "Impacts of Climate Change on Biodiversity, Ecosystems, and Ecosystem Services," is one of a suite of studies feeding into what will be the third National Climate Assessment, an overarching analysis of impacts on everything from transportation systems to public health. </p>

Summit Voice <em> December 19, 2012<p>by Bob Berwyn </p></em>
<p>A major new report suggests that climate change will probably result in a net loss in global biodiversity, as plants and animal species shift their geographic ranges and the timing of their life events — such as flowering, laying eggs or migrating — at faster rates than researchers documented just a few years ago.</p>

<p>Water funds are taking off like a wildfire in Latin America. But like a wildfire, they run the risk of burning too hot and too fast to help the ecology (and the people) in the system. The rapid expansion of water funds in latitudes south has presented some challenges for The Nature Conservancy and its partners, which are trying to make the most of a potentially great tool for bringing nature's value into the real economy.</p>

Nature News<em>August 29th, 2012<p> Featuring Nathaniel Mueller and Jon Foley </p></em>
<p>With 9 billion people expected to be alive in 2050, researchers are running out of time to develop new ways to feed them sustainably. But an analysis published today in Nature suggests that strategies already exist that could shrink the 'yield gap' — which they define as the difference between attainable and actual yields of food crops. Assembling the most comprehensive global data set of crop yields and fertilizer use yet produced, the study authors show that yield increases of 45–70% are possible for most crops through improved nutrient management and increased use of irrigation.</p>

New Scientist - by Sara Reardon - <em>June 16, 2012<p> Featuring Gretchen Daily and Peter Kareiva</p></em>
<p> When appeals to an environmental
conscience cannot motivate
governments to conserve their
natural resources, a swift kick in the
wallet may. That's the idea behind a
strategy expected to be discussed at the
Rio+20 United Nations Conference on
Sustainable Development next week.
Gaining traction are projects to
quantify the value of "services"
provided to us by oceans, forests and
other ecosystems, determine the
economic hit to a nation once they
run out, and then paying would-be
consumers to conserve those assets.
And, with characteristic pragmatism,
China is leading the experiment.</p>

<p> Healthy ecosystems provide us with fertile soil, clean water, timber, and food. They reduce the spread of diseases. The protect against flooding.

<p>Peter Kareiva had come to answer for his truths.</p>

<p>Settling at the head of a long table ringed by young researchers new to the policy world, Kareiva, chief scientist of the Nature Conservancy, the world's largest environmental organization, cracked open a beer. After a long day mentoring at the group's headquarters, an eight-story box nestled in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, he was ready for some sparring.</p>

<p>The scientists had read Kareiva's recent essay, which takes environmentalists to task. The data couldn't bear out their piety, he wrote. Nature is often resilient, not fragile. There is no wilderness unspoiled by man. Thoreau was a townie. Conservation, by many measures, is failing. If it is to survive, it has to change.</p>

<p>Environmental policy is something of a family business for Mary Ruckelshaus. Her father, the attorney William Ruckelshaus, became the first administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, when she was in fourth grade, and returned for a second term in the mid-1980s. "We had a lot of great dinner table discussions," she recalls, but her own interest was in science more than legal policy. A Ph.D. in biology led her to Seattle, where she worked on salmon and orca recovery for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In 2010 she became managing director of the Natural Capital Project, an environmental think tank based at Stanford University. Advancing ideas developed by co-founder Gretchen Daily in her groundbreaking books Nature's Services and <em>The New Economy of Nature</em>, the project's team of biologists, economists, data analysts, and legal scholars collaborates with governments and NGOs to fairly value ecosystem services</p>

Plant and animal species are shifting their geographic ranges and the timing of their life events – such as flowering, laying eggs or migrating – at faster rates than researchers documented just a few years ago, according to a technical report on biodiversity and ecosystems used as scientific input for the 2013 Third National Climate Assessment. The report, <a href="http://downloads.usgcrp.gov/NCA/Activities/Biodiversity-Ecosystems-and-Ecosystem-Services-Technical-Input.pdf">Impacts of Climate Change on Biodiversity, Ecosystems, and Ecosystem Services</a>, synthesizes the scientific understanding of the way climate change is affecting ecosystems, ecosystem services and the diversity of species, as well as what strategies might be used by natural resource practitioners to decrease current and future risks. More than 60 federal, academic and other scientists, including the lead authors from the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Wildlife Federation and Arizona State University in Tempe, authored the assessment.</p>

  <p><strong>A Global System to Monitor Nature's Benefits to Society</strong></p>
<a href="pubs/GEOBON_PR_11-16-2012.pdf" target="_blank">Press Release - <em>November 16th, 2012</em></a><br/>
</p>
<p>A new paper appearing in the November issue of Bioscience presents a way to monitor ecosystem
services on a global scale. The conceptual framework they suggest to do this was envisioned by the
GEO BON Ecosystem Services Working Group and designed to integrate national statistics,
numerical models, remote sensing, and in situ measurements to regularly track changes in
ecosystem services across the globe. Although this may sound overly ambitious, the paper outlines
an achievable approach that would fill the pulse-taking role well. Entitled "A Global System for
Monitoring Ecosystem Change," the paper was led by Heather Tallis, Lead Scientist at the Natural
Capital Project. Its authors present a tangible plan to coordinate, standardize, and broaden access to
existing databases that track and monitor the delivery of ecosystem services. Their work
contributes to the worldwide effort of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), to improve the
availability of information on the global environment.</p>
