    <p>The world has been abuzz with the dramatic losses of cultivated honey bees due to colony collapse disorder as well as declines of native pollinator species across the globe. Scientists have recently begun calculating the extent to which food crops depend on animal pollinators including bees, butterflies, and bats, with one study assigning an economic value to the "ecosystem service" provided by pollinators at approximately $167 billion. Even more recently, several other new studies have offered evidence that pollinators may also have a beneficial impact on nutrition security-the availability of essential macro- and micronutrients in the human diet.</p><br/>

<p>The glamour of my first field work remains personally unsurpassed. Snorkelling in turquoise waters among shimmering oyster beds in the Cook Islands, I had a creeping suspicion this was uncommon territory for economists. I was working with pearl farmers who insert a small ball into each oyster. To protect itself, the oyster coats the ball with layer upon layer of iridescent nacre, creating a beautiful black pearl.</p><br/>

<p>Most people appreciate a beautiful sunset. But for the resources we depend on daily &#8212 food, energy and clean water &#8212 it's easy not to give a second thought to their value.</p> <p>A group with field offices around the U.S., including at the University of Washington, is trying to change that. The Natural Capital Project wants to integrate the socioeconomic, cultural and spiritual values of nature into all major decisions affecting the environment and human well-being.

<p>I've done the math, and for $1.20, you can preserve a 19-inch by 19-inch square of rainforest habitat-home, on average, to 0.000006 long-tailed macaques and 0.0000001 pangolins. All you have to do is pay a bit more for palm oil, found in roughly half of all grocery store items: chocolate bars, cereal, and lipstick, to name a few.</p> <p>"Most people probably consume some palm oil every day," says David Wilcove, a professor of ecology at Princeton University. The ubiquitous stuff is squeezed from the fruit of trees whose rapidly expanding cultivation has infamously contributed to widespread deforestation in southeast Asia, and increasingly, parts of South America and Africa.</p><p>I derived the numbers above from a study appearing this week in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</i>, part of a collection authored by over 80 researchers from 50 institutions spanning ten different countries.

<p>In Latin America and around the world, payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs represents a growing approach to conservation. In many cases, these programs aim to tackle social and environmental goals at the same time through, for example, improving the livelihoods of farmers while also encouraging more sustainable land-use practices. Ecuador's SocioBosque program, a national-scale program that pays rural farmers and communities to conserve their forest or native highland grasslands (pï¿½ramos) is a good example of a PES program. In this case, SocioBosque and its nested SocioPï¿½ramo program (focused on highland Andean grasslands) strive to protect biodiversity, ensure ample and clean water, store carbon, and reduce poverty among participant farmers and rural communities.</p><br/>

<p>The west coast of Vancouver Island boasts the kind of wild shoreline that could swallow a kayaker for weeks. Crenellated with fjords and stippled with islands, it's a place where old-growth stands of Doug-fir yield to rocky beaches, where black bears stalk the tidelines, and where, each March, some 20,000 gray whales cruise by en route to the Bering Sea. Yet even in this natural outpost, human enterprises clash: Cargo freighters and commercial fishermen spar over shipping lanes and fishing grounds; salmon- farmers and kayak guides struggle for control of coastal waters; -logging, mining and resort-building threaten seagrass beds.</p><br/>

<p>The idea of valuing nature's services to people is not new.

<p>It's projected that $57 trillion will be spent on new infrastructure projects by 2030, much of it in developing countries. Because such projects can damage or destroy critical environmental services, nearly 200 countries as well as many financial institutions - including International Finance Corporation and Equator Principals Financial Institutions, which provide more than 70 percent of international project finance debt in developing economies - now require developers to assess and mitigate any environmental costs. The trouble is the current offset approach too often results in restoration efforts taking place far from where the ecosystem was damaged.</p><br/>

<p>The worldwide decline of pollinators could increase cases of vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies in humans, new research suggests. For instance, pollination is needed for the crops that produce half of all plant-derived vitamin A across much of south-east Asia. Furthermore, areas which depend most on pollination for micronutrient supply tend to be poorer and already at higher risk of
deficiencies.</p><br/>

Now, the encouraging news: a recent study published in Science suggests that farmers have the power to prevent a lot of these extinctionsï¿½and the loss of millions of years of evolutionary history (called phylogenetic diversity) that these species representï¿½simply by adopting changes in their practices like crop diversification and maintaining habitat near their fields.</p><br/>

<p>Agriculture has an enormous footprintï¿½by some estimates, it accounts for more than 90 percent of humanity's water use. One of the other areas where its footprint is felt is in carbon emissions.

<p>If all the food used to fatten up cows, chickens and pigs went straight to people instead, it would feed several billion more people than the food does today, according to a new study. "We've taken 10,000 years to get to the point of growing as much food as we are doing now," said Paul West, a food expert at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul. "In the next four decades or so we have to figure out how to double that ï¿½. Another thing that is simultaneously occurring is that agriculture has the biggest effect on our environment." Fortunately for meat lovers, completely forgoing burgers, wings, and bacon won't be necessary. But, when weather or disease lays waste to a lot of food, crops traditionally grown for animal feed could serve as a safety valve in times of need, West said. These and a handful of other targeted strategies could provide enough new calories to meet the basic needs for more than 3 billion people, West and colleagues conclude in their paper published Thursday in the journal Science.</p>

<p>Something is happening in our river valleys, on fertile farmlands and along our shorelines. Record floods and tides make clear that something has changed. "We're sitting here on the pointy end of the pineapple express," says Jay Gordon, a third-generation farmer on the Chehalis River and executive director of the Washington State Dairy Federation. "The climate-change theory that we're going to see more rain and more floods ï¿½ it's not a theory. We're living it."</p>

<em>NPR - Krulwich Wonders, December 6th, 2013<p> by Robert Krulwich</p></em>
<p>This is an alarming story, not because it ends badly. It's alarming because it ends well. It shouldn't have, but it did, and biologists (and especially conservationists) now have a puzzle to ponder. The story begins in central China, in an apple-growing region called Maoxian County, near the city of Chengdu. In the mid-1990s, the bees that regularly showed up there every spring suddenly didn't. Apple farmers, obviously, need bees. Bees dust their way through blossoms, moving from flower to flower, pollinating, which helps produce apples in September. What happened to the bees?</p>

Eighteen years ago, as a young scientist on the rise, Daily arrived at a renowned research station in the hills of Costa Rica armed with nearly 100 shellacked plywood platforms. As a student at Stanford University, studying under the famed biologist Paul Ehrlich, she had seen how large birds, defying expectations, seemed to thrive on small bits of forest spackled in the area's coffee plantations, when theory predicted their demise. On her return, she planned to spread her feeding platforms in staggered densities to test that observation; local kids promised to monitor the <em>mesitas</em>.</p>

<p>Conservationists are used to justifying their work. Since the movement first took shape in the 1800s, they've provided a litany of contemporary arguments for conserving the natural world, from economic (protecting forests for wood) to spiritual (preserving places that stir the soul) to scientific (safeguarding biological systems). But lately they've been wrestling internally with another fundamental question about their task: not why we should save nature, but what exactly we should save and how we should save it. Against a backdrop of growing global resource demand and climate change ï¿½ as well as emerging technologies, such as synthetic biology ï¿½ that are wreaking philosophical havoc, finding the answers is urgent.</p>

Nature News<em>August 29th, 2012<p> Featuring Nathaniel Mueller and Jon Foley </p></em>
<p>With 9 billion people expected to be alive in 2050, researchers are running out of time to develop new ways to feed them sustainably. But an analysis published today in Nature suggests that strategies already exist that could shrink the 'yield gap' ï¿½ which they define as the difference between attainable and actual yields of food crops. Assembling the most comprehensive global data set of crop yields and fertilizer use yet produced, the study authors show that yield increases of 45ï¿½70% are possible for most crops through improved nutrient management and increased use of irrigation.</p>

New Scientist - by Sara Reardon - <em>June 16, 2012<p> Featuring Gretchen Daily and Peter Kareiva</p></em>
<p> When appeals to an environmental
conscience cannot motivate
governments to conserve their
natural resources, a swift kick in the
wallet may. That's the idea behind a
strategy expected to be discussed at the
Rio+20 United Nations Conference on
Sustainable Development next week.
Gaining traction are projects to
quantify the value of "services"
provided to us by oceans, forests and
other ecosystems, determine the
economic hit to a nation once they
run out, and then paying would-be
consumers to conserve those assets.
And, with characteristic pragmatism,
China is leading the experiment.</p>

<p>Peter Kareiva had come to answer for his truths.</p>

<p>Settling at the head of a long table ringed by young researchers new to the policy world, Kareiva, chief scientist of the Nature Conservancy, the world's largest environmental organization, cracked open a beer. After a long day mentoring at the group's headquarters, an eight-story box nestled in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, he was ready for some sparring.</p>

<p>The scientists had read Kareiva's recent essay, which takes environmentalists to task. The data couldn't bear out their piety, he wrote. Nature is often resilient, not fragile. There is no wilderness unspoiled by man. Thoreau was a townie. Conservation, by many measures, is failing. If it is to survive, it has to change.</p>

<p>Environmental policy is something of a family business for Mary Ruckelshaus. Her father, the attorney William Ruckelshaus, became the first administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, when she was in fourth grade, and returned for a second term in the mid-1980s. "We had a lot of great dinner table discussions," she recalls, but her own interest was in science more than legal policy. A Ph.D. in biology led her to Seattle, where she worked on salmon and orca recovery for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In 2010 she became managing director of the Natural Capital Project, an environmental think tank based at Stanford University. Advancing ideas developed by co-founder Gretchen Daily in her groundbreaking books Nature's Services and <em>The New Economy of Nature</em>, the project's team of biologists, economists, data analysts, and legal scholars collaborates with governments and NGOs to fairly value ecosystem services</p>

<p>Billions of dollars are spent every year on development projects such as mines, energy plants and transportation systems. While most countries require mitigation to offset environmental degradation that results, none requires an explicit accounting of people in these efforts.  Scientists at the Natural Capital Project (NatCap), led by Lead Scientist Heather Tallis, have developed a new approach to mitigation and habitat restoration that identifies winners and losers ï¿½ people who would lose ecosystem services and those who would gain them in these circumstances.</p>

</p>
<p>Ecosystem services, the benefits people get from nature, sustain and fulfill human life.  Many have suggested that an explicit focus on ecosystem services can lead to management choices with better outcomes for people and the ecosystems on which they depend.  But compelling evidence of the science of modeling, mapping, and valuing ecosystem services informing real decisions has, to date, been scarce. Dr. Guerry presented that evidence today, in a symposium session at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), by showcasing how the Natural Capital Project's use of ecosystem service approaches and tools have been used to inform decisions in diverse contexts worldwide.  These contexts include spatial planning, payment for ecosystem services, climate adaptation planning, permitting and mitigation, restoration planning, and corporate risk management. </p>

Plant and animal species are shifting their geographic ranges and the timing of their life events ï¿½ such as flowering, laying eggs or migrating ï¿½ at faster rates than researchers documented just a few years ago, according to a technical report on biodiversity and ecosystems used as scientific input for the 2013 Third National Climate Assessment. The report, <a href="http://downloads.usgcrp.gov/NCA/Activities/Biodiversity-Ecosystems-and-Ecosystem-Services-Technical-Input.pdf">Impacts of Climate Change on Biodiversity, Ecosystems, and Ecosystem Services</a>, synthesizes the scientific understanding of the way climate change is affecting ecosystems, ecosystem services and the diversity of species, as well as what strategies might be used by natural resource practitioners to decrease current and future risks. More than 60 federal, academic and other scientists, including the lead authors from the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Wildlife Federation and Arizona State University in Tempe, authored the assessment.</p>

</p>
<p>A new paper appearing in the November issue of Bioscience presents a way to monitor ecosystem
services on a global scale. The conceptual framework they suggest to do this was envisioned by the
GEO BON Ecosystem Services Working Group and designed to integrate national statistics,
numerical models, remote sensing, and in situ measurements to regularly track changes in
ecosystem services across the globe. Although this may sound overly ambitious, the paper outlines
an achievable approach that would fill the pulse-taking role well. Entitled "A Global System for
Monitoring Ecosystem Change," the paper was led by Heather Tallis, Lead Scientist at the Natural
Capital Project. Its authors present a tangible plan to coordinate, standardize, and broaden access to
existing databases that track and monitor the delivery of ecosystem services. Their work
contributes to the worldwide effort of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), to improve the
availability of information on the global environment.</p>
