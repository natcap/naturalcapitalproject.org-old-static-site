<p>First, the depressing news: humanity is driving half of all life on Earth to extinction, mainly through land conversion for agriculture. Now, the encouraging news: a recent study published in Science suggests that farmers have the power to prevent a lot of these extinctions—and the loss of millions of years of evolutionary history (called phylogenetic diversity) that these species represent—simply by adopting changes in their practices like crop diversification and maintaining habitat near their fields.</p><br/>

<p>With worldwide food production expected to double by 2050, it's almost inevitable that agriculture is going to have to expand in a warming world with a growing population. A new study suggests that if new farmland is created carefully, billions of tons of carbon emissions could be saved.</p>

<p>Agriculture has an enormous footprint—by some estimates, it accounts for more than 90 percent of humanity's water use. One of the other areas where its footprint is felt is in carbon emissions. Converting land to agriculture disrupts the existing soil ecosystem, releasing carbon stored there into the atmosphere; a large fraction of humanity's collective carbon emissions fall under the category of "land use change."</p>

<p>One out of every eight people in the world goes hungry. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, which calculated this figure, has also reported that 852 million of these 870 million hungry people live in developing countries. Worse, the world population will likely balloon from its present 7.1 billion to 9.6 billion by 2050. Scientists say this will be coupled with a projected doubling in demand for crops by that same year.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel like a broken record at home: "Let's eat the leftovers for dinner, so they don't go to waste," But inevitably, Sunday night's pasta and meatballs get tossed out of the refrigerator to make way for Friday night's pizza. Now scientists at the University of Minnesota offer up another reason to put those leftover meatballs in the tummy instead of the garbage: There are hidden calories in the beef that go to waste when you toss it.</p>

<p>If all the food used to fatten up cows, chickens and pigs went straight to people instead, it would feed several billion more people than the food does today, according to a new study. "We've taken 10,000 years to get to the point of growing as much food as we are doing now," said Paul West, a food expert at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul. "In the next four decades or so we have to figure out how to double that …. Another thing that is simultaneously occurring is that agriculture has the biggest effect on our environment." Fortunately for meat lovers, completely forgoing burgers, wings, and bacon won't be necessary. But, when weather or disease lays waste to a lot of food, crops traditionally grown for animal feed could serve as a safety valve in times of need, West said. These and a handful of other targeted strategies could provide enough new calories to meet the basic needs for more than 3 billion people, West and colleagues conclude in their paper published Thursday in the journal Science.</p>

<em>CGIAR Agriculture and Ecosystems Blog, June 6, 2014<p>by Becky Chaplin-Kramer</em>
<p>Since the Green Revolution, we've been relying heavily on a strategy to control variability in agricultural systems, as we strive to minimize agricultural nuisances such as soil infertility, pest impacts, and inadequate precipitation through the use of chemicals and irrigation. This has won us some major successes in increasing yields, but at high cost to the many other benefits provided in and by agricultural landscapes.</p>

<p>As it stands right now, the world has a little over 7 billion people. Come 2050, however, that "7" will look more like a "9," and those 2 billion extra mouths could mean disaster for the planet's already-strained resources. Jonathan Foley wrote the cover story for the May issue of National Geographic magazine, kicking off an eight-month series on food and sustainability. In his words: "We've got to get more value out of agriculture.We need to figure out how to feed a growing and more prosperous world, but we also have to figure out how to make it more sustainable."</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be factory farms versus small, organic ones. There's another way. When we think about threats to the environment, we tend to picture cars and smokestacks, not dinner. But the truth is, our need for food poses one of the biggest dangers to the planet.</p>

<em>Foreign Affairs, March/April 2014<p> by Jon Hoekstra</p></em>
<p>Conservation is for the first time beginning to operate at the pace and on the scale necessary to keep up with, and even get ahead of, the planet's most intractable environmental challenges. New technologies have given conservationists abilities that would have seemed like super powers just a few years ago. We can now monitor entire ecosystems -- think of the Amazon rainforest -- in nearly real time, using remote sensors to map their three-dimensional structures; satellite communications to follow elusive creatures, such as the jaguar and the puma; and smartphones to report illegal logging.</p>

<p>This is an alarming story, not because it ends badly. It's alarming because it ends well. It shouldn't have, but it did, and biologists (and especially conservationists) now have a puzzle to ponder. The story begins in central China, in an apple-growing region called Maoxian County, near the city of Chengdu. In the mid-1990s, the bees that regularly showed up there every spring suddenly didn't. Apple farmers, obviously, need bees. Bees dust their way through blossoms, moving from flower to flower, pollinating, which helps produce apples in September. What happened to the bees?</p>

Eighteen years ago, as a young scientist on the rise, Daily arrived at a renowned research station in the hills of Costa Rica armed with nearly 100 shellacked plywood platforms. As a student at Stanford University, studying under the famed biologist Paul Ehrlich, she had seen how large birds, defying expectations, seemed to thrive on small bits of forest spackled in the area's coffee plantations, when theory predicted their demise. On her return, she planned to spread her feeding platforms in staggered densities to test that observation; local kids promised to monitor the <em>mesitas</em>.</p>

<em>Huffington Post, September 27th, 2013<p>by NatCap Visiting Scholar Alon Tal</p></em>
<p>Overpopulation remains the leading driver of hunger, desertification, species depletion and a range of social maladies across the planet. Recently, a spate of op-ed essays have filled the pages of some of world's top newspapers and blogs -- from the Guardian to the New York Times -- challenged this view, declaring that overpopulations is not, nor has ever been, a problem. To make progress in the most recent round of the age-old debate between technological optimists and Malthusian realists, it's important to establish criteria and characterize consequences.</p>

<em>Ensia, July 22nd, 2013<p>by Hillary Rosner</p></em>
<p>Conservationists are used to justifying their work. Since the movement first took shape in the 1800s, they've provided a litany of contemporary arguments for conserving the natural world, from economic (protecting forests for wood) to spiritual (preserving places that stir the soul) to scientific (safeguarding biological systems). But lately they've been wrestling internally with another fundamental question about their task: not why we should save nature, but what exactly we should save and how we should save it. Against a backdrop of growing global resource demand and climate change — as well as emerging technologies, such as synthetic biology — that are wreaking philosophical havoc, finding the answers is urgent.</p>

<p>In the wake of Superstorm Sandy, a study suggests that conservation can protect potential storm victims. Unfortunately for America's coastal cities, Superstorm Sandy was not an aberration. The storm that left so many Northeasterners stranded in flooded homes without electricity was just the first of many to be expected as sea levels continue to rise due to climate change. Cities are constructing plans to protect themselves from future storms—Mayor Michael Bloomberg released his strategy for New York City to the tune of $20 billion this month—scientists, engineers and politicians are seeking out innovative ways to protect our coastlines. A new study suggests that conservation of our ecosystems may be the answer.</p>

<p>Katrina, Sandy, Andrew: iconic names….and indelible examples of how nature can kill and destroy. But could nature actually help reduce our risk from…nature? Specifically: could sand dunes, oyster and coral reefs, sea grasses and other coastal natural habitats blunt the effects of coastal storms — like surges and flooding? Could they even reduce the risk of fatalities and property loss from such storms? They already are — for at least 1.3 million people and billions in property value along the U.S. coastline, according to a new study just published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Neglecting those habitats, the study adds, could double the number of U.S. residents at "high hazard risk" from storms — including hundreds of thousands of poor and elderly. </p>

Dr. Kareiva joined The Nature Conservancy in 2002, where his projects focus on the interplay of human land-use and biodiversity, resilience in the face of global change, and marine conservation. His academic achievements include over 100 publications spanning a broad range of topics and membership to The American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is known for a willingness to challenge paradigms and encourages members of our field to think critically about the purpose of our science and how to communicate it to the public. These themes ran through our conversation as we discussed the pitfalls of a single-minded focus on biodiversity, his hopes for the future of our field, strategies for advocacy, and the promise of citizen science.</p>

<p>Settling at the head of a long table ringed by young researchers new to the policy world, Kareiva, chief scientist of the Nature Conservancy, the world's largest environmental organization, cracked open a beer. After a long day mentoring at the group's headquarters, an eight-story box nestled in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, he was ready for some sparring.</p>

<p>The scientists had read Kareiva's recent essay, which takes environmentalists to task. The data couldn't bear out their piety, he wrote. Nature is often resilient, not fragile. There is no wilderness unspoiled by man. Thoreau was a townie. Conservation, by many measures, is failing. If it is to survive, it has to change.</p>

<em>Featuring Mary Ruckelshaus, Managing Director of the Natural Capital Project</em></p>

<p>Environmental policy is something of a family business for Mary Ruckelshaus. Her father, the attorney William Ruckelshaus, became the first administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, when she was in fourth grade, and returned for a second term in the mid-1980s. "We had a lot of great dinner table discussions," she recalls, but her own interest was in science more than legal policy. A Ph.D. in biology led her to Seattle, where she worked on salmon and orca recovery for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In 2010 she became managing director of the Natural Capital Project, an environmental think tank based at Stanford University. Advancing ideas developed by co-founder Gretchen Daily in her groundbreaking books Nature's Services and <em>The New Economy of Nature</em>, the project's team of biologists, economists, data analysts, and legal scholars collaborates with governments and NGOs to fairly value ecosystem services</p>

<p>London, 8 July 2014 – The Natural Capital Coalition (NCC) is pleased to announce its selection of two consortia to develop what will be known as the Natural Capital Protocol. The Protocol will provide a methodology for businesses across the world to understand the impacts that they have and the extent to which they are dependent on the natural environment, its finite natural resources and functioning ecosystems. It will provide previously invisible, yet crucial, information for business decision-making and risk-management. Proponents of the Natural Capital Protocol see it as a major game-changer in building the business case for sustainability.</p>

</p>
<p>Freshwater is one of the planet's most scarce resources. Demand for it is growing, and climate change threatens its supply. A new, free software tool, the Resource Investment Optimization System (RIOS), could be part of the solution. Using the RIOS approach in Colombia, for example, has improved the return on investment by up to 600 percent over previous approaches to watershed investment.</p>

    <p><strong>Redeeming Sins of Omission: Accounting for People in Mitigation
</strong></p>
<a href="pubs/ServiceshedsPR.pdf" target="_blank">Press Release - <em>February 16th, 2013</em></a><br/>
</p>
<p>Billions of dollars are spent every year on development projects such as mines, energy plants and transportation systems. While most countries require mitigation to offset environmental degradation that results, none requires an explicit accounting of people in these efforts.  Scientists at the Natural Capital Project (NatCap), led by Lead Scientist Heather Tallis, have developed a new approach to mitigation and habitat restoration that identifies winners and losers – people who would lose ecosystem services and those who would gain them in these circumstances.</p>

<a href="pubs/ESinActionPR.pdf" target="_blank">Press Release - <em>February 16th, 2013</em></a><br/>
</p>
<p>Ecosystem services, the benefits people get from nature, sustain and fulfill human life.  Many have suggested that an explicit focus on ecosystem services can lead to management choices with better outcomes for people and the ecosystems on which they depend.  But compelling evidence of the science of modeling, mapping, and valuing ecosystem services informing real decisions has, to date, been scarce. Dr. Guerry presented that evidence today, in a symposium session at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), by showcasing how the Natural Capital Project's use of ecosystem service approaches and tools have been used to inform decisions in diverse contexts worldwide.  These contexts include spatial planning, payment for ecosystem services, climate adaptation planning, permitting and mitigation, restoration planning, and corporate risk management. </p>

Plant and animal species are shifting their geographic ranges and the timing of their life events – such as flowering, laying eggs or migrating – at faster rates than researchers documented just a few years ago, according to a technical report on biodiversity and ecosystems used as scientific input for the 2013 Third National Climate Assessment. The report, <a href="http://downloads.usgcrp.gov/NCA/Activities/Biodiversity-Ecosystems-and-Ecosystem-Services-Technical-Input.pdf">Impacts of Climate Change on Biodiversity, Ecosystems, and Ecosystem Services</a>, synthesizes the scientific understanding of the way climate change is affecting ecosystems, ecosystem services and the diversity of species, as well as what strategies might be used by natural resource practitioners to decrease current and future risks. More than 60 federal, academic and other scientists, including the lead authors from the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Wildlife Federation and Arizona State University in Tempe, authored the assessment.</p>

  <p><strong>A Global System to Monitor Nature's Benefits to Society</strong></p>
<a href="pubs/GEOBON_PR_11-16-2012.pdf" target="_blank">Press Release - <em>November 16th, 2012</em></a><br/>
</p>
<p>A new paper appearing in the November issue of Bioscience presents a way to monitor ecosystem
services on a global scale. The conceptual framework they suggest to do this was envisioned by the
GEO BON Ecosystem Services Working Group and designed to integrate national statistics,
numerical models, remote sensing, and in situ measurements to regularly track changes in
ecosystem services across the globe. Although this may sound overly ambitious, the paper outlines
an achievable approach that would fill the pulse-taking role well. Entitled "A Global System for
Monitoring Ecosystem Change," the paper was led by Heather Tallis, Lead Scientist at the Natural
Capital Project. Its authors present a tangible plan to coordinate, standardize, and broaden access to
existing databases that track and monitor the delivery of ecosystem services. Their work
contributes to the worldwide effort of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), to improve the
availability of information on the global environment.</p>

		<p>New technologies are now giving conservationists abilities that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. Using remote sensors, satellite mapping and drones, scientists and activists can now monitor deforestation and endangered wildlife in real time. And a new Wiki-leaks-style website is being used to target the kingpins of wildlife smuggling. But like many technologies, these new tools have risks. Tracking devices in the hand of poachers, for example, could prove devastating to endangered elephants.</p>
