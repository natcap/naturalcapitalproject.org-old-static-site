<p>Spencer Wood works directly with partner organisations in Canada and Belize who are revising and evaluating their coastal management plans, using tools produced by the Natural Capital Project. His scientific research focuses on empirical and mathematical approaches to understanding interactions between humans and the environment in complex socio-ecological networks. This includes studies on patterns of tourism in Belize, ancient human settlement in the Aleutian Islands, and distributions of species interactions in New Zealand and British Columbia.  Previously, Wood participated in a variety of ecological studies on intertidal biodiversity, nearshore wave transformation, coastal sedimentation, and fire recovery.  He earned his PhD from the University of British Columbia and is currently based in Seattle, WA.</p>

<p>Guy Ziv is leading NatCap's work  with the EPA and Department of Defense. He is a physicist experienced in modeling natural and artificial complex systems. His past projects include analyzing trade-offs between hydropower dams construction and fish biodiversity and productivity in the Mekong River Basin, and quantifying bird communities resilience to agricultural intensification in Costa-Rica. His research interest is the interplay between policy, land management decisions and land use change impacts on Environmental Services. He holds a Ph.D. in Physics from the Weizmann Institute of Science, and was a Research Associate at Princeton University before joining the Natural Capital Project.</p>
